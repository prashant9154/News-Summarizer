            "NAVAL mines floating in the Black Sea apparently remain a problem for Filipino sailors and others as dozens of ships “marooned” need to ensure a safe landing at Kyiv ports. The mines, according to Russian sources, have been left there floating by Ukraine in order to influence the Philippines’s stance in respect of the Ukraine crisis. The Philippines was one of 160 countries that signed the United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s February 24 invasion of Ukraine, but it has so far continued to engage Moscow diplomatically.  The Russian sources asserted that Kyiv is deliberately blocking the Black Sea and continues to evade the liberation of its controlled harbors in the sealane.   In contrast, sources claimed that Russia has completed the de-mining of Berdyansk and Mariupol ports to ensure the safe passage of ships, especially those carrying grains that other countries need. Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other over who is to blame for the late deliveries of cargo due to the mined sea routes. Food prices have already spiked, leading to inflationary spirals that have affected many countries that include the Philippines.   In early June, a UN alert was cited in a Bloomberg report as saying that the Pinoy seafarers account for a third of the 450 sailors trapped in 80 ships stranded near the Black Sea ports. The other sailors come from Syria, Azerbaijan and Turkey. The naval mines problem in the Black Sea was earlier the focus of attention of UN Maritime Security Adviser Peter Adams who expressed worry over the disastrous effects of the mines to cargo ships.   Adams said that it will take some time before the sea routes can be safely navigated on, and this will have disastrous effects on shipping, especially of grains, of which both Russia and Ukraine are key producers.  This, at a time when global supply chains have already been reeling from the logistics problems that began in the pandemic. Your email address will not be published.

I urge partners to provide Ukraine with modern missile defense systems as soon as possible. Help us save lives and put an end to this war,\" Kuleba said.From CNN's Niamh Kennedy in London Norway has pledged one billion euros in funding to support the \"brave people\" of Ukraine, the country's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre announced during a trip to Kyiv on Friday. Addressing journalists during a joint news conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Gahr Støre said he had \"to come to Ukraine to express Norway's solidarity with the people of Ukraine.\" The funding will be used to provide humanitarian aid and support Ukraine's defense and reconstruction efforts, according to Gahr Støre. Zelensky thanked his Norwegian counterpart for the support package, saying Ukraine appreciates that it has \"real friends\" nearby. Zelensky called Norway a \"diligent and rational member of the international community,\" referencing the country's decision to support European Union sanctions against Russia despite not being a member of the bloc. The Ukrainian leader also responded to the Russian missile strike on the port city of Odesa carried out during the early hours of Friday, calling it another example of an \"act of terror against our cities.\" \"This brutality from Russia yet again confirms how correct the decision of our partners was to support Ukraine with defensive weapons. No country should be left alone against this evil and I'm grateful to Norway,\" Zelensky continued, highlighting how the country supported Ukraine \"straight away.\" From CNN's Jonny Hallam and Cristiana MoisescuIn the aftermath of Russia's early morning missile strikes on a residential area near Odesa in southern Ukraine, Moldova's Minister of Health Ala Nemerenco has said one of the buildings struck in the attack was a rehabilitation center for treating Moldovan children with health problems.In a statement on Facebook, Nemerenco said that although the building itself was not badly damaged, with only windows smashed in part of the building, one employee was killed and five were injured following the strike. The Moldovan-owned rehabilitation center gave \"children with health problems in the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to benefit from medical rehabilitation services on the Black Sea coast,\" Nemerenco said.Nemerenco paid tribute to the facilities' medical staff who were injured and killed in the Russian bombardment.The center had been closed to patients since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said Nemerenco. No children are thought to have been at the center at the time of the attack.After Finland was formally invited to join the NATO this week, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto spoke to CNN about the new world order where Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbor Russia becomes a security threat.Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"has changed the security atmosphere,\" he added.Pekka also said there are concerns about \"the loose talks about the nuclear weapons, the chemical weapons,\" leading the world back to the Cuba missile crisis during the Cold War.\"Yes we have a strong traditional military. We have our F-35s coming and so forth. But what if we're threatened by unconventional weapons?\" Pekka said about Finland's security concerns.Finland Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told CNN that \"of course\" war in Europe beyond Ukraine is a possibility. Following decades of neutrality, Finland — along with Sweden — was formally invited to join NATO this week during the alliance's summit in Madrid, marking a historic expansion of the defense bloc that directly undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims as his war in Ukraine grinds ahead.The group collectively decided to approve countries' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO's most consequential enlargement in decades. The decision will now go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO's leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession and a show of unity against Putin.When asked if Ukraine can win the war, Haavisto said, \"They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are of course morally on the high ground. They are very united.\"\"They need our support,\" he added. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed reporting to this post. From CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Anna Chernova, Radina Gigova and Chris LiakosThe prosecutor in the trial of WNBA player Brittney Griner announced the charges against her during a hearing Friday in a court near Moscow, Russian state news agency TASS reported.  At the Khimki City Court, Griner was accused by a prosecutor of smuggling less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The prosecution believes that then Griner had the intention to import the drugs into Russia's territory and put the prohibited substances into a backpack and a suitcase, according to TASS.The Phoenix Mercury star plays in Russia during the WNBA’s off-season and was arrested at a Moscow airport a week before Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. When Griner arrived on a flight from New York to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Feb. 17, \"two cartridges of hashish oil were found in her hand luggage during an inspection,\" according to TASS.Cannabis oil is subject to control on the territory of the Russian Federation and is classified as narcotic drugs, according to TASS. The offense of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance is punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Russia. US Embassy Charge d’Affaires Elizabeth Rood said she was able to speak with Griner inside the courtroom and that the US government is working \"very hard\" to bring Griner and other \"wrongfully detained citizens\" safely home. Griner’s lawyers, Alexander Boykov and Maria Blagovolina, said they were unaware of any plans to exchange Griner for a Russian prisoner held in the US in an impromptu presser at the end of the first day of her trial. The court will continue to hear the case next week on July 7 at 2:30 p.m. local time.Later on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that officials from the US embassy in Russia \"attended Brittney Griner’s trial today in Moscow.\"\"We – and I personally – have no higher priority than bringing her and other wrongfully detained Americans, including Paul Whelan, home,\" he said in a tweet Friday, referencing another unlawfully detained American there.\"We won’t stop working until they are reunited with their loved ones,\" Blinken said.What Griner's wife says: Cherelle Griner, the wife of WNBA star Brittney Griner, told CNN on Thursday she wants US officials to do whatever they have to do to bring the basketball legend home – and she needs to see them do more.She also said she would “absolutely” like to meet with US President Joe Biden and humanize Brittney to him so he can “see BG as we see BG.”“While everyone wants to tell me they care, I’d love for him to tell me he cares,” she added.Read more from her interview here. CNN's Abby Phillip, Steve Almasy and Jennifer Hansler contributed reporting to this post. The death toll from Russia's overnight strikes in the Odesa region has risen to 20, Ukraine's emergency services have said.At least 16 people were killed in a residential building, and four more – including one child –were killed in another strike on a recreation center.A third strike landed in a field, authorities said. A rescue operation is ongoing and 38 people were injured in the strikes.Previous updates from Ukrainian authorities suggested two children had been killed.“We don't expect to find anyone alive, but there is a chance,” first deputy interior minister Yevhenii Yenin said earlier on Friday, speaking from the scene of the attacks. From CNN's Oleksandra OchmanFollowing Russia's withdrawal from Snake Island in the Black Sea, Ukraine hopes that strikes on the territory around Odesa will decrease, a spokesman for the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, Andrii Demchenko, said Friday.“It’s now known why the enemy took the island. They filled the territory with the means of destruction and fired from them,” Demchenko said at a briefing. “We hope now shelling of the territory of Ukraine will decrease.”Demchenko went on to say he hoped the Ukrainian border service would be able to return to the island soon.“The situation with Snake Island remains tense as the enemy could have mined the ways to the island. Now the situation is being monitored and investigated,” he explained. “I hope the Ukrainian border guards will return to this piece of Ukrainian land as soon as possible.”From CNN's Radina Gigova in London Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Western sanctions are pushing Russia and Belarus toward \"speeding up integration\" in various sectors, which he said would \"minimize the damage\" of the sanctions. \"Russia and Belarus continue to grow in their cooperation in the political, trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian spheres,\" Putin said in a video message to the participants of an annual Russia-Belarus forum on Friday\"The unprecedented pressure of sanctions from the so-called collective West is pushing us towards speeding up integration. Together it is easier to minimize the damage from the illegal sanctions, it is easier to set up the production of demanded products, develop new competencies and expand cooperation with friendly countries,\" Putin said. Belarus is a staunch Russian ally and helped facilitate Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, with some Russian forces entering the country through the Ukrainian-Belarusian border.A number of joint programs between the two nations have already been developed and more are on track for the coming years, Putin said. Areas of cooperation include technological and industrial innovation, finances and transport.Putin said the joint programs were aimed at creating \"equal economic conditions for our countries\" and would \"form a reliable framework for a financial market and transports base.\"His message comes just days before Belarus celebrates its independence from Nazi Germany on July 3, and as Russia and Belarus marked 30 years of diplomatic relations earlier this year. Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.Remains of a missile are seen near a rail station, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Kramatorsk, Ukraine April 8, 2022. The writing reads: \"Because of children\". REUTERS/Stringer/File PhotoJuly 1 (Reuters) - As Russia's military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and other lethal weapons, Western nations have responded in part by targeting Russia's defense industry with sanctions. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"war machine.\"But a Reuters examination of companies, executives and investors underpinning Russia's defense sector shows a sizable number of players have yet to pay a price: Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom. In addition, sanctions on Russia's arms makers and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by these NATO allies, with some governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed.Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned by any of those three authorities is Alan Lushnikov, the largest shareholder of Kalashnikov Concern JSC, the original manufacturer of the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters.The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year.The company accounts for 95% of Russia's production of machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and other handheld firearms, and 98% of its handheld military machine guns, according to its website and most recent annual report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by Ukrainian soldiers. The Kalashnikov Concern also produces missiles that can be fired from aircraft or on land.A former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin’s “inner circle.”Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to requests for comment.It’s the same pattern with Almaz-Antey Concern, a Moscow-based defense company specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but CEO Yan Novikov has not been punished.Almaz-Antey’s website displays the motto “Peaceful Sky is Our Profession.” The company makes Kalibr missiles, which Russia’s Ministry of Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military installations. In a statement last month, the ministry said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the Ukrainian military.Reuters was unable to independently verify that claim.Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to the countries that introduced them.\"The Reuters findings come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that current Western sanctions against Russia “are not enough” as Russian troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine’s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks of intense fighting.Putin has portrayed his military’s assault on Ukraine as a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarizing and “denazifying” its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia indefinitely in what it said was a response to “constantly expanding U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures.”U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia's action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\"The Russian invasion has killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of the casualties were caused by the use of “explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” and that the actual number of dead and wounded was likely far higher.The West has levied sanctions on a swath of Russia’s economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access to imported components and generally make it more costly and time-consuming to produce weaponry. Levying sanctions on the people behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain personal. It allows Western nations to go after any mansions, yachts and other offshore wealth of those who supply Russia’s military, and it limits where they can travel abroad.“You’re demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S. military technology. “They feel it very personally. You’re creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the Kremlin,” said Bergmann, now director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based national security think tank.Other companies in Russia’s defense industry identified by Reuters that have not been sanctioned by the United States, EU or UK include the V.A. Degtyarev Plant(ZDEGI.MM), a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military. Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles.The Degtyarev Plant did not respond to a request for comment.Also not sanctioned is the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant, south of Moscow, where “world-famous cartridges” for pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles are produced, according to an archived version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an ammunition manufacturer that calls itself “one of the leading engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia.”Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment.Last month, Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and United States regarding the news agency’s findings that they had failed to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin’s war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain, said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and its allies had levied “the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin’s war machine.” The European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that sanctions have “made it harder for Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons.”On Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters.One of those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key roles in Russia’s weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2 executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its website and annual reports. Artyakov is also the chairman of at least five Russian weapons firms, among them Russian Helicopters JSC, which builds several lines of military helicopters including the Ka-52 \"Alligator,\" some of which have been shot down and documented in Ukraine.He has not been sanctioned by the EU or UK.Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for comment.Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had not been sanctioned.Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to requests for comment.Other firms on Reuters’ list that were sanctioned just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60.PJSC Tupolev and another firm on Reuters’ list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the country’s most advanced missile systems.PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII Signal did not respond to requests for comment.Executives at a host of Russian weapons firms, meanwhile, have largely escaped sanctions from Western authorities.Nearly three months after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price. The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured more than 100 others.The Russian firm JSC Research and Production Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S. Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington, Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM’s chief executive.The three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander Denisov, the CEO of NPO High Precision Systems, KBM’s parent company. High Precision Systems oversees production of a wide range of missiles, artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian troops and outfitted on military helicopters, aircraft, tanks and warships.Sanctions on Russia’s arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the Western allies. The United States and EU have sanctioned High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not.High Precision Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment. KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond to additional questions submitted by Reuters.Europe and the United States have failed to coordinate sanctions even on makers of banned weapons.Since the outset of Russia’s invasion in late February, Western governments and human rights groups have decried its use of cluster munitions: small bombs delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on civilians.Russia used a Uragan – which translates to “Hurricane” – rocket launcher system to fire cluster bombs in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and Ukrainian officials.The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and Production Association Splav, a Russian firm whose systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU. Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions altogether.Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests for comment.It’s much the same for Splav’s parent company, NPK Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by American or European authorities.Techmash and Kochkin did not respond to requests for comment.In a June 10 statement, the European Commission said there is an effort to align sanctions lists “as much as legally possible” among allies to achieve “the maximum cumulative effect of the sanctions with all our like-minded partners.” In cases where the lists do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not currently on the EU’s sanctions list could be added later if there is sufficient evidence.\"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said.One of the highest-profile Russian firms to escape Western sanctions is VSMPO-Avisma Corp(VSMO.MM), which is the world’s largest titanium supplier and 25% owned by Rostec. It supplies Russia’s defense industry, but also counts major Western aerospace companies among its clients.Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and annual reports. That’s no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense experts who spoke with Reuters.VSMPO-Avisma’s vice chairman and majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by Forbes this year as Russia’s 59th-richest person, likewise has not been sanctioned.According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK.VSMPO-Avisma also sells to Europe’s Airbus(AIR.PA), and it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing Co(BA.N) up until March, when the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier “for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes.”VSMPO-Avisma and shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient supply for airplane production.\"Airbus did not answer specific questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium “would massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe” while doing little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of that nation's overall exports.In 2020, foreign sales accounted for about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma’s $1.25 billion in revenue, according to the company’s most recent annual report.That puts Western officials in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk sanctions themselves.“That’s the classic sanctions conundrum: If you want to hurt somebody, you’re going to hurt yourself,” Connolly said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey's veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedTwo children among dead after apartment building and recreation centre struck; Zelenskiy says journey to membership ‘shouldn’t take decades’The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed. A 12-year-old boy was among the dead, he added. Ukraine’s security service had earlier put the death toll at 19. Two children were among the dead and six others among dozens injured, officials said. Authorities also said that 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 people lived.The “very heavy and very powerful” missiles were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, Bratchuk said. He said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The worst-case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odesa region.The Kremlin has denied targeting civilians. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier today. Talina Zharikova first met people who had fled fighting in Donbas in a bomb shelter near her flat in the south-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro when the invasion started. For a while, she and her neighbours hosted them in their flats. But there were quickly more people than they could house, so Zharikova decided to ask about renovating an abandoned Soviet hospital opposite their block of flats.Zharikova, her neighbours, other Dnipro residents and those who had fled fighting set about renovating the building, which had been empty for a decade. There are now 240 people living in the various rooms in the shelter, known as Good on Love, and they say there is room for another 100.The shelter is one of more than 60 set up by Dnipro residents for evacuees. As the first city of relative safety outside many frontline areas, Dnipro has become Ukraine’s aid hub. Thousands who live there, many left jobless by the war, have thrown themselves into volunteering.Like other volunteers in Dnipro, Zharikova said the financial burden has been immense.“The city authorities didn’t help, so I fed them all with my own money for the first month. My husband is fighting at the front and I went out and got out what money I had,” said Zharikova, a former hotel manager.Read the full story by Isobel Koshiw: The informal volunteer groups leading Ukraine’s aid effortA Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reports.The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass.Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports. The cooking of borsch, a beetroot and cabbage soup, in Ukraine has been added to the United Nations cultural agency’s list of endangered heritage because of Russia’s invasion.The Ukrainian culture of cooking borsch, considered a national dish, has been included on Unesco’s “list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding”. Borsch is also widely consumed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland. The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “negative impact on this tradition” caused by the war, Unesco said.“People are unable not only to cook or grow local vegetables for borsch, but also to come together” to eat it, “which undermines the social and cultural well-being of communities”, it said. Ukraine’s minister of culture, Tkachenko Oleksandr, celebrated the decision on Twitter, tweeting: “Victory in the war for borsch is ours!”Перемога у війні за борщ- наша! 🇺🇦Як і всі наступні💪🏻На позачерговому засіданні Міжурядового комітету з охорони нематеріальної культурної спадщини за зверненням @MKIPUkraine “Культура приготування українського борщу” внесено до Списку нематеріальної культурної спадщини @UNESCO pic.twitter.com/iTMNub1ZO1Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, also welcomed Unesco’s decision, saying: “Ukrainian Borsht derussified!”Ukrainian Borsht derussified!At extraordinary meeting @UNESCO Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage unanimously decided to include🇺🇦element \"Culture of Ukrainian borscht cooking\" into the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding1/2 pic.twitter.com/DGHVX6q6eZRussia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, ridiculed the move, claiming “as I understand, everything is subject to Ukrainisation”.Ukraine has requested that Turkey detain and arrest a Russian-flagged cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain, Reuters reports.The ship, Zhibek Zholy, was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” from the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk and headed to Karasu, Turkey, with 7,000 tonnes of cargo, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a letter to Turkey’s justice ministry.Separately, a Ukrainian foreign ministry official said the ship had loaded the first cargo of some 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdiansk, which the official said belonged to Ukraine.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain from occupied areas. The Kremlin has denied that Russia has stolen any Ukrainian grain. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said war in Europe beyond Ukraine is “of course” a possibility and urged countries to support Kyiv.In an interview with CNN, Haavisto was asked if Ukraine can win the war against Russia. He replied:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are, of course, morally on the high ground. They are very united.On Tuesday, Finland, Sweden and Turkey signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later said Finland and Sweden must keep the promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.Earlier today, Haavisto told a news conference that Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during the negotiations at the Nato summit in Madrid earlier this week. Referring to a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Haavisto told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We agreed that now we have a signed text and everything that we have signed is in the text. We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals or any listings [with Turkey].Haavisto told CNN that Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbour Russia becomes a security threat.Haavisto said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I think it’s a new reality. I really think that the European security architects [have] been broken. It’s a new situation. There’s a new kind of iron wall between Russia and the other countries. And of course, it’s based on Russia’s aggression against its neighbour Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has changed the security atmosphere”, he added.The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed.

Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he has been forced to take part in “educational activities” including being made to sit for hours under a portrait of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Navalny was transferred last month to a strict-regime penal colony near the town of Vladimir east of Moscow, described by his allies as “one of Russia’s scariest prisons”. In a post on Facebook, he described his life in the new prison where he said he had to sew for seven hours, five days a week. Navalny said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}After work, you continue to sit. For several hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called ‘educational activities’. Even on Sundays, his official day off, he said he was made to sit on a wooden bench in a room for 10 years. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I don’t know who such activities can ‘educate’, except for a crooked invalid with a bad back. But maybe that’s the purpose.Navalny has described his new jail as a “prison within a prison” and said he was serving time with convicted murderers. In a Twitter thread, he compared his prison life to Putin and Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvdev, and said there was a loudspeaker in his barrack that plays songs like “Glory to the FSB”.1/12 I live like Putin and Medvedev.At least I think so when I look at the fence around my barrack. Everyone has the usual fence, and inside there are rods to dry the laundry on.6/12 6:00 - Wake up. Ten minutes to make bed, wash, shave, etc.6:10 - Exercise.6:20 - Escort to breakfast.6:40 - Search and escort to work.At work, you sit for 7 hours at the sewing machine on a stool below knee height.10:20- 15-minute lunch break.10/12 But you know me, I'm an optimist and look for the bright side even in my dark existence. I have as much fun as I can. While sewing, I've memorised Hamlet's monologue in English.Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports have fallen 43% year-on-year to 1.41m tonnes in June, having slumped since the start of the war as its Black Sea ports – the key route for shipments – have been largely closed off.Reuters reports the ministry said farmers in southern and eastern Ukraine had already started the 2022 harvest, threshing 293,800 tonnes of grain from around 1% of the sown area.The government has previously said Ukraine could harvest up to 65m tonnes of grain and oilseeds this year, compared with 106m in 2021, due to the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields.The process of Sweden and Finland joining Nato appears to have some difficulty ahead of it yet. The invitation must be ratified in parliament by all 30 allies, and there still seems to be some conflict between the Nordic countries and Turkey over what was agreed earlier in the week in Madrid. Turkey had threatened to veto their membership bids.Reuters reports that this morning Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during negotiations at the Nato summit.“We agreed that now we have a signed a text and everything that we have signed is in the text,” Haavisto told a news conference in Helsinki. “We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals.”Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said yesterday that Finland and Sweden must keep promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.After four hours of talks in Madrid on Tuesday, Turkey, Finland and Sweden signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships, imposed by Ankara in May due to its concerns about terrorism. The signed memorandum did not list any individuals for extradition.Schools in Kyiv will reopen for classes for the start of the school year on 1 September, the city’s authorities said.Schools in the Ukrainian capital are now on summer holiday after going online when Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. The head of Kyiv’s education and science department, Olena Fidanyan, was cited by AFP as saying that the most important task for the new school year “is the safety of students and teachers”.Territories adjacent to the schools will be checked for explosives and bomb shelters in schools will be restocked with water, medicine and other necessities, she said. All schools will hold “the necessary training with teachers and children on actions during an air-raid alert”, she added.Those children who have not been able to return to Kyiv will be able to study remotely, Fidanyan said.Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff.Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow.Earlier this week, Bulgaria’s prime minister, Kiril Petkov, said his country would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff on espionage concerns. The move was the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats by Sofia in recent years and more than halved the size of Moscow’s diplomatic footprint in Bulgaria.Mitrofanova called the expulsions an “unprecedented hostile” step and on Thursday told Sofia to reverse its decision by midday on Friday.In a statement released by the embassy today, Mitrofanova said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Unfortunately, our appeal to the Bulgarian foreign ministry has been ignored.She added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I intend to quickly put the question of the closure of Russia’s embassy in Bulgaria before my country’s leadership, which will inevitably mean the closure of the Bulgarian diplomatic mission in Moscow.Responsibility for the “grave consequences of this step” will rest with Petkov’s government, Mitrofanova said. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum.The move puts many of them in a difficult position. If they do not sign, they will lose their jobs and be at risk of retaliation from Russian forces. If they sign, there is the risk of charges from Ukrainian authorities, which view teaching the Russian curriculum as a form of collaboration with the enemy.The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine whose identities, for safety reasons, cannot be revealed. They said that around mid-June newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July either to sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign, with many of them being threatened with eviction from their homes.The Russian education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, announced in June that when the new school year began in September all schools in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were to work according to Russian standards.“We will do our best to open schools on 1 September so that they are as ready as possible to function according to Russian standards,” Kravtsov said. “Integration will take place. We are already taking some steps in this direction: teacher training and the supply of textbooks.”One teacher living in a village in the occupied area of Kharkiv said: “At the moment, only history, geography, language and primary schoolteachers were asked to sign the document.”“Math, physics, biology and chemistry curriculum in Russia don’t carry propaganda, so they are left alone, at least for now,” he added.Read the full article by Lorenzo Tondo: Moscow forcing teachers in Ukraine to sign up to Russian curriculumEight people have now been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials.Ukraine’s state emergency service reported late last night that the body of a man was discovered under a collapsed staircase, bringing the total death toll to eight and six wounded. On Wednesday, mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed.\n",

            "        AT LEAST 17 people were killed and dozens wounded today in missile strikes on Ukraine’s Odessa region, a day after Russian troops abandoned positions on a strategic island in a major setback to the Kremlin’s invasion.The news came after Nato leaders wrapped up a summit in Madrid, with US President Joe Biden announcing $800 million in new weapons for Ukraine.“We are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance are going to stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes to make sure they are not defeated by Russia,” he said.But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared surging diplomatic tensions to the Cold War, telling reporters: “As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending… The process has begun.”There was a glimmer of hope however, when Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited Moscow on Thursday after a trip to Kyiv, said he had given Russian President Vladimir Putin a message from their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Neither side has revealed what was in the note.Hours after the summit ended, missiles were fired at an apartment building and recreation centre in the southern region of Odessa, a strategic flashpoint that is home to Ukraine’s historic port city of the same name.The nine-storey apartment building was partially destroyed, leaving 14 people dead and 30 wounded, including several children, the emergency services said.Three people, including a child, were killed and one wounded in the attack on the recreation centre, they said.\n",

            "\n",
            "    Source: AP/PA ImagesThe strikes, in the Bilgorod-Dnistrovsky district, were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, said Odessa military administration spokesman Sergiy Bratchuk.“The worst case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odessa region,” he said in a TV interview, adding they had fired “very heavy and very powerful” missiles.Bratchuk urged people not to post online information about the rescue operation.‘Goodwill gesture’The early Friday strikes came a day after Russian troops abandoned their positions on Snake Island, off the coast of Odessa.The island had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the first days of the war, when the rocky outcrop’s defenders told a Russian warship to “go f*ck yourself” after it called on them to surrender — an incident that spurred a defiant meme.It was also a strategic target, sitting aside shipping lanes near the port of Odessa. Russia had attempted to install missile and air defence batteries while under fire from drones.The decision to abandon Snake Island “changes the situation in the Black Sea considerably,” Zelenskyy said in his daily address yesterday.“It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already considerably limits the actions of the occupiers.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited Snake Island as he warned the Russian president that any eventual peace deal would be on Ukraine’s terms.“We’ve seen what Ukraine can do to drive the Russians back. We’ve seen what they did around Kyiv and Kharkiv, now on Snake Island,” Johnson said.The Russian defence ministry statement described the retreat as “a gesture of goodwill” meant to demonstrate that Moscow will not interfere with UN efforts to organise protected grain exports from Ukraine.But Ukraine officials claimed it as a win.“They always downplay their defeats this way,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.In peacetime, Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter, but Russia’s invasion has damaged farmland and seen Ukraine’s ports seized, razed or blockaded — threatening grain importers in Africa with famine.Western powers have accused Putin of using the trapped harvest as a weapon to increase pressure on the international community, and Russia has been accused of stealing grain.‘Direct threat’Yesterday, a ship carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain sailed from Ukraine’s occupied port of Berdyansk, said the regional leader appointed by the Russian occupation forces.Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Moscow administration, said Russia’s Black Sea ships “are ensuring the security” of the journey, adding that the port had been de-mined.Separately, the Russian defence ministry said its forces are holding more than 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war who have been captured since the February 24 invasion.The conflict in Ukraine dominated the Nato summit in Madrid this week, as the alliance officially invited Sweden and Finland to join, and Biden announced new deployments of US troops, ships and planes to Europe.\n",

            "        Russian missiles continued to rain down elsewhere in Ukraine and a United Nations official said Thursday that 16 million people in Ukraine were in need of humanitarian aid.In the southern city of Mykolaiv, rescuers found the bodies of seven civilians in the rubble of a destroyed building, emergency services said.The city of Lysychansk in the eastern Donbas region — the current focus of Russia’s offensive — is also facing sustained bombardment.The situation in Lysychansk — the last major city the Russians need to take over in the Lugansk region — was “extremely difficult” with relentless shelling making it impossible to evacuate civilians, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said.“There is a lot of shelling… The Russian army is approaching from different directions,” he said in a video posted on Telegram.© AFP 2022To embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n",

            "TheJournal.ie Latest News FeedStrikes in Southern Ukraine leave 17 dead after Russia evacuates Snake Island CommentsCreate an email alert based on the current articleSERHIIVKA, Ukraine, July 1 (Reuters) - Russia flattened part of an apartment building while residents slept on Friday in missile attacks near Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa that authorities say killed at least 21 people, hours after Russian troops abandoned a nearby outpost at Snake Island.Neighbours in the resort village of Serhiivka helped workers comb through the rubble of the nine-storey apartment block, a section of which had been completely destroyed at 1:00 a.m.Walls and windows of a neighbouring, 14-storey apartment block had also been damaged by the blast wave. Nearby holiday camps were also hit.\"We came here to the site, assessed the situation together with emergency workers and locals, and together helped those who survived. And those who unfortunately died. We helped to carry them away,” said Oleksandr Abramov, who lives nearby and had rushed to the scene when he heard the blast.Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa regional administration, said 21 people had been confirmed killed, including a 12-year-old boy. Authorities said earlier 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 lived.The regional governor said the Soviet-era missiles had been fired from the direction of the Black Sea.The Kremlin denied targeting civilians: \"I would like to remind you of the president's words that the Russian Armed Forces do not work with civilian targets,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The attack came just four days after Russia struck a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine killing at least 19 people.Kyiv says Moscow has dramatically escalated its long-range attacks hitting civilian targets far from the front line in recent days, which Ukraine describes as a war crime. Russia says it has been aiming at military sites.Thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Ukraine says is an unprovoked war of aggression. Russia calls the invasion a \"special operation\" to root out nationalists.On Thursday, Russia pulled its troops off Snake Island, a desolate but strategically important outcrop that it seized on the war's first day and had used to control the northwestern Black Sea, where it has blockaded Odesa and other ports.In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed what he described as a strategic victory at Snake Island.\"It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet ensure that the enemy will not come back,\" he said. \"But this significantly limits the actions of the occupiers. Step by step, we will push them back from our sea, our land and our sky.\"Rescue workers work at the scene of a missile strike at a location given as Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa region, Ukraine, in this handout image released July 1, 2022.? State Emergency Services of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERSIn Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmakers gave a standing ovation as the flag of the European Union was carried through the chamber to stand alongside Ukraine's own flag behind the dais, a symbol of Ukraine's formal EU candidate status granted last week.Zelenskiy and the lawmakers also stood for a minute of silence for those killed in the morning attacks near Odesa.Russia's stepped up campaign of long-range missile attacks on Ukrainian cities has come as its forces have ground out success on the battlefield in the east, with a relentless assault to force Kyiv to cede two provinces to separatists.Moscow has been on the verge of capturing one of those provinces, Luhansk, since taking the city of Sievierodonetsk last week after some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Ukraine's last bastion in Luhansk is the city of Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets river, which is close to being encircled under relentless Russian artillery assault.The Russians were shelling Lysychansk from different directions and approaching from several sides, regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Ukrainian television.\"The superiority in fire power of the occupiers is still very much in evidence,\" Zelenskiy said. \"They have simply brought in all their reserves to hit us.\"In Russian-occupied Sievierodonetsk, residents have emerged from basements to sift through the rubble of their city.\"Almost all the city infrastructure is destroyed. We are living without gas, electricity, and water since May,\" Sergei Oleinik, 65, told Reuters. \"We are glad that this ended, and soon maybe reconstruction will start, and we will be back to more or less normal life.\"But after its losses in the east, the Ukrainian victory at Snake Island gives Kyiv a major success in the Black Sea. The island has been a national symbol since the first day of the war when a Ukrainian guard ordered by Russia to surrender radioed back: \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself.\"Russia has used its control of the sea to impose a blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, threatening to shatter Ukraine's economy and cause global famine.Moscow denies it is to blame for a food crisis, which it says is caused by Western sanctions hurting its own exports. President Vladimir Putin met the president of Indonesia on Thursday and spoke by phone on Friday to the prime minister of India, promising both major food importers that Russia would remain a big supplier of grain.Pushing the Russians off Snake Island could be a step towards reopening Odesa's port, although military analysts say Russia could still threaten cargo ships at sea.Ukraine hopes to inflict enough damage in the east to exhaust Russia's advancing army, and turn the tide in coming months with advanced weapons arriving from the West.In the latest sign of Russia's split with Europe, Russia's ambassador in Bulgaria said she would call for her embassy to be shut, along with Bulgaria's embassy in Moscow, following Sofia's refusal to reinstate diplomats it expelled for spying.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey's veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedAt least 19 dead after Russian missile strikes multi-story apartment building in Odesa; Russian forces withdraw from Snake Island in Black SeaAt least 19 people, including two children, have been confirmed dead after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries, Ukraine’s security service said. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. Speaking at the scene, Yenin said rescue operations were ongoing but “we don’t expect to find anyone alive”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Peskov told reporters.Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said “There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union.”Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. He said “Our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.”Ukrainian forces said Thursday they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes.The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.”Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said on Thursday. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference.A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk on Thursday for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying.Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible.Joe Biden declared that the US and Nato allies will stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” as the military alliance promised hundreds of thousands more troops to defend eastern Europe. The US president also announced on Thursday another $800m of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained over how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack.Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday. After the Nato summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said leaders had decided to support Kyiv “to make sure Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state in Europe”.Turkey’s president has warned that Ankara could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that if the two Nordic countries reneged on their promises, including to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday.Estonian and Latvian defence ministers signed a letter of intent on Thursday at the Nato summit in Madrid for joint procurement of medium-range anti-aircraft systems.“The aggression of Russia in Ukraine clearly shows the need for air defence systems,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a statement.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would deliver six Caesar howitzers and a “significant number” of armoured vehicles to Ukraine. He added that the Nato allies meeting in Madrid “unanimously decided” to boost humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Asked whether the British government believed Russia could be pushed out of all of Ukraine within a foreseeable timeframe, Truss replied: “It is realistic, and that is why we are supplying the extra lethal aid we’re supplying.”Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, to protest against Boris Johnson’s “offensive” remarks regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”, it said in a statement.Norway’s foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday, Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Huitfeldt said Norway was not blocking Russian access to the Arctic archipelago, only applying international sanctions, and that Russia had other means to reach its settlements.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Moscow on Thursday, where he will urge Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire and seek ways to allow the export of grain from Ukraine. Widodo also met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday during a visit he described as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine”.{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}“We are fighting for our country and Western values,” explain Ukrainians. “And we won’t stop.”More than anything, it is this sense of patriotism and resourcefulness – and a little bit of help from Ukraine’s friends – that is likely to determine the war’s outcome. The British spy George Blake, who defected to the Soviet Union, said just before his death in 2020 that spies now have “the difficult and critical mission” of saving the world “in a situation when the danger of nuclear war and the resulting self-destruction of humankind again have been put on the agenda by irresponsible politicians. It’s a true battle between good and evil.”Blake, who went over to the Russian side while a prisoner during the Korean War, may have inadvertently been describing Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible assault on Ukraine. Unless the Russian leader wanted another Cold War, he has (so far) failed dramatically in strategic terms: first, in his aim to “liberate” Ukrainians from their government, and second, to curtail Nato’s enlargement. With Finland and Sweden joining, he now has a much larger Nato on his borders – a 1,340km longer Nato, to be precise. He has ignited a fierce Ukrainian patriotism. I have driven through more than 3,500km of Ukraine north to south over the past three months: there is scarcely a building without Ukrainian flags, banners, posters and painted walls. How might this war end?The presence of such nationalism, shaped by the anvil of conflict and genocide under the Holodomor perpetrated by Stalin in the 1930s – in which millions of Ukrainians died of starvation due to the confiscation of their wheat – reduces the scenario options. Those scenarios, which have Russia maintaining control over all or some of the roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory now occupied, can only be temporary – the conflict frozen, but unresolved. The challenge for Ukraine is not only in stopping Russia grinding out its advances – for which heavier precision Western weaponry is required – but finding the means to remove them. Unlike Russia, which has simply destroyed the cities targeted, such as Mariupol and now Severodonetsk, Ukraine’s counterattacks have to be tactically more astute and avoid civilian damage and casualties – it’s their own people and country, after all. This outcome is not entirely down to Nato assistance, of course, but depends also on Russia’s economic and military strength. The signs are not hopeful, given the claimed Russian military losses – 30,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, 2,500 armoured vehicles, more than 500 aircraft and 600 drones – which are expensive and time-consuming to replace, not least because of the skills required. This will test the Russian economy, even if you believe the Russian media’s claim that it’s thriving due to a higher oil price. At between $2-million and $5-million a pop for a tank, and at least 15 times for a fighter aircraft, war is expensive – and that is before Western sanctions begin to bite, which they will by the end of this year when Europe has committed to cut off Russian oil imports, a principal export earner.   To some extent, the outcome depends on how the region works with Ukraine to get its trade routes for its commodities back up and running, including through Moldova, Romania and Poland especially. It will also rely on what the world has learnt from Putin. There will inevitably be those who call for appeasement, even though the record of feeding such authoritarians chunks of other people’s territory is seldom a formula for a durable peace. Until now, Putin has successfully portrayed himself as a man who will stop at nothing, an irrational actor – “a monkey with a grenade”. But this is a tactic designed to keep the West guessing at his unpredictability, especially over the use of nuclear weapons. Equally, when Russia decides to disengage – such as it did in redeploying its forces from around Kyiv in April or more recently from Snake Island – there was no monkeying around in the orderly and efficient withdrawal.  But the West, too, possesses nuclear weapons. Deterrence is as much about politics, staying power and signalling as it is about hardware. Nato’s problems have stemmed from its disparate organisational and political complement, though for now the differences in approach between its members are smaller than at any time in the post-Cold War order.  And to the greatest extent, the outcome depends on the extent of Ukrainian fighting spirit and political will. For the moment, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s approval ratings are over 80%. Whether this support will flag the longer the war drags on and the costs mount, or whether Ukrainians will further harden their position towards Russia as a consequence, remains to be seen. For now, most Ukrainians are not interested in compromise. They demand compensation and justice. It seems that this war will not end – conventionally or through a long-term insurgency – without a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. Those terms are, after all, what most countries would expect. The human cost of the conflict thus makes a deal trading land for peace politically very difficult for Zelensky, no matter his obvious skills. After all, it is Ukraine that has been invaded. The recent history of eastern and central Europe suggests that this occupation will, no matter the Russian propaganda, be bloody but temporary.

Western commentators said on Thursday (June 30) that the retreat of the Russians marks a major setback, and likely weakens their control over shipping routes that are key to Moscow’s strategic objectives.Last week Ukraine had said it had caused “significant losses” to Russia in airstrikes on the island. That hit was believed to be the second major military success using missiles given to the regime in Kyiv by the West.The Ukrainians had earlier claimed a first successful use of Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Reuters had reported, quoting British Military Intelligence.Both Moscow and Kyiv confirmed the Russian retreat. The Ukrainians said the Russians had caved in to sustained targeting of the island and Russian supply lines by missiles and artillery fire for more than a week.The last Russian soldiers had left on two speedboats during the night, the Ukrainian military said. “There are no more Russians on Zmiinyi (the Ukrainian name for the island),” The New York Times quoted Andrii Yermak, the head of the presidential office of Ukraine, as saying.The Ukrainian military had said on Tuesday (June 28) that it had destroyed three anti-aircraft missile systems that were recently installed by the Russians on the island. The radar had been knocked out, as a result of which Russia could no longer assist its soldiers on the island.The Russian defence ministry too said it had left the island, but sought to paint it as “a gesture of goodwill” that would “not allow Kyiv to speculate on the impending food crisis”, The NYT report said.Russian warships and submarines in the Black Sea have blocked Ukrainian grain exports, which averaged 5 million tonnes per month before the war. The crucial port of Odessa in the western Black Sea is still under Ukrainian control, but Western analysts were saying the Russian withdrawal from Snake Island did not necessarily mean traffic from the port would be more secure against Russian attacks.Snake or Serpent Island, called Zmiinyi in Ukrainian, is a rocky outcrop that extends less than 700 metres from end to end, and is often described as being “X-shaped”. It is located 35 km from the coast, to the east of the mouth of the Danube and roughly southwest of Odessa.The island has been known since ancient times. Tales about it go back to the mythological Trojan war, Reuters reported. It has a long association with Achilles, the mythical Greek warrior who was invincible but for his vulnerable heel.Today, the island is marked on the map by the tiny village of Bile that is located on it. The island is close to the coast of Romania, with which Ukraine has had a dispute — and which was settled in 2009 by the International Court of Justice, which drew a new maritime border between the two countries, a Reuters report said. Parts of the Black Sea around Snake Island are believed to hold significant oil and gas reserves.On February 24, the day Russia launched its invasion, two warships from the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Vasily Bykov and Moskva, attacked Snake Island, followed by Russian troops landing on it. A Ukrainian soldier’s salty response — “Russian warship, go f**k yourself” — quickly became the stuff of war legend. Ukraine issued a postage stamp celebrating his defiance, and in April, destroyed the Moskva, the 600-foot flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which had attacked the island on day 1 of the war.Newsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) for the latest news and updatesFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App.\n"

            "NAVAL mines floating in the Black Sea apparently remain a problem for Filipino sailors and others as dozens of ships “marooned” need to ensure a safe landing at Kyiv ports. The mines, according to Russian sources, have been left there floating by Ukraine in order to influence the Philippines’s stance in respect of the Ukraine crisis. The Philippines was one of 160 countries that signed the United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s February 24 invasion of Ukraine, but it has so far continued to engage Moscow diplomatically.  The Russian sources asserted that Kyiv is deliberately blocking the Black Sea and continues to evade the liberation of its controlled harbors in the sealane.   In contrast, sources claimed that Russia has completed the de-mining of Berdyansk and Mariupol ports to ensure the safe passage of ships, especially those carrying grains that other countries need. Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other over who is to blame for the late deliveries of cargo due to the mined sea routes. Food prices have already spiked, leading to inflationary spirals that have affected many countries that include the Philippines.   In early June, a UN alert was cited in a Bloomberg report as saying that the Pinoy seafarers account for a third of the 450 sailors trapped in 80 ships stranded near the Black Sea ports. The other sailors come from Syria, Azerbaijan and Turkey. The naval mines problem in the Black Sea was earlier the focus of attention of UN Maritime Security Adviser Peter Adams who expressed worry over the disastrous effects of the mines to cargo ships.   Adams said that it will take some time before the sea routes can be safely navigated on, and this will have disastrous effects on shipping, especially of grains, of which both Russia and Ukraine are key producers.  This, at a time when global supply chains have already been reeling from the logistics problems that began in the pandemic. Your email address will not be published.

I urge partners to provide Ukraine with modern missile defense systems as soon as possible. Help us save lives and put an end to this war,\" Kuleba said.From CNN's Niamh Kennedy in London Norway has pledged one billion euros in funding to support the \"brave people\" of Ukraine, the country's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre announced during a trip to Kyiv on Friday. Addressing journalists during a joint news conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Gahr Støre said he had \"to come to Ukraine to express Norway's solidarity with the people of Ukraine.\" The funding will be used to provide humanitarian aid and support Ukraine's defense and reconstruction efforts, according to Gahr Støre. Zelensky thanked his Norwegian counterpart for the support package, saying Ukraine appreciates that it has \"real friends\" nearby. Zelensky called Norway a \"diligent and rational member of the international community,\" referencing the country's decision to support European Union sanctions against Russia despite not being a member of the bloc. The Ukrainian leader also responded to the Russian missile strike on the port city of Odesa carried out during the early hours of Friday, calling it another example of an \"act of terror against our cities.\" \"This brutality from Russia yet again confirms how correct the decision of our partners was to support Ukraine with defensive weapons. No country should be left alone against this evil and I'm grateful to Norway,\" Zelensky continued, highlighting how the country supported Ukraine \"straight away.\" From CNN's Jonny Hallam and Cristiana MoisescuIn the aftermath of Russia's early morning missile strikes on a residential area near Odesa in southern Ukraine, Moldova's Minister of Health Ala Nemerenco has said one of the buildings struck in the attack was a rehabilitation center for treating Moldovan children with health problems.In a statement on Facebook, Nemerenco said that although the building itself was not badly damaged, with only windows smashed in part of the building, one employee was killed and five were injured following the strike. The Moldovan-owned rehabilitation center gave \"children with health problems in the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to benefit from medical rehabilitation services on the Black Sea coast,\" Nemerenco said.Nemerenco paid tribute to the facilities' medical staff who were injured and killed in the Russian bombardment.The center had been closed to patients since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said Nemerenco. No children are thought to have been at the center at the time of the attack.After Finland was formally invited to join the NATO this week, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto spoke to CNN about the new world order where Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbor Russia becomes a security threat.Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"has changed the security atmosphere,\" he added.Pekka also said there are concerns about \"the loose talks about the nuclear weapons, the chemical weapons,\" leading the world back to the Cuba missile crisis during the Cold War.\"Yes we have a strong traditional military. We have our F-35s coming and so forth. But what if we're threatened by unconventional weapons?\" Pekka said about Finland's security concerns.Finland Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told CNN that \"of course\" war in Europe beyond Ukraine is a possibility. Following decades of neutrality, Finland — along with Sweden — was formally invited to join NATO this week during the alliance's summit in Madrid, marking a historic expansion of the defense bloc that directly undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin's aims as his war in Ukraine grinds ahead.The group collectively decided to approve countries' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO's most consequential enlargement in decades. The decision will now go to the 30 member states' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO's leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession and a show of unity against Putin.When asked if Ukraine can win the war, Haavisto said, \"They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are of course morally on the high ground. They are very united.\"\"They need our support,\" he added. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed reporting to this post. From CNN's Fred Pleitgen, Anna Chernova, Radina Gigova and Chris LiakosThe prosecutor in the trial of WNBA player Brittney Griner announced the charges against her during a hearing Friday in a court near Moscow, Russian state news agency TASS reported.  At the Khimki City Court, Griner was accused by a prosecutor of smuggling less than a gram of cannabis oil in her luggage. The prosecution believes that then Griner had the intention to import the drugs into Russia's territory and put the prohibited substances into a backpack and a suitcase, according to TASS.The Phoenix Mercury star plays in Russia during the WNBA’s off-season and was arrested at a Moscow airport a week before Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. When Griner arrived on a flight from New York to Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Feb. 17, \"two cartridges of hashish oil were found in her hand luggage during an inspection,\" according to TASS.Cannabis oil is subject to control on the territory of the Russian Federation and is classified as narcotic drugs, according to TASS. The offense of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance is punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Russia. US Embassy Charge d’Affaires Elizabeth Rood said she was able to speak with Griner inside the courtroom and that the US government is working \"very hard\" to bring Griner and other \"wrongfully detained citizens\" safely home. Griner’s lawyers, Alexander Boykov and Maria Blagovolina, said they were unaware of any plans to exchange Griner for a Russian prisoner held in the US in an impromptu presser at the end of the first day of her trial. The court will continue to hear the case next week on July 7 at 2:30 p.m. local time.Later on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that officials from the US embassy in Russia \"attended Brittney Griner’s trial today in Moscow.\"\"We – and I personally – have no higher priority than bringing her and other wrongfully detained Americans, including Paul Whelan, home,\" he said in a tweet Friday, referencing another unlawfully detained American there.\"We won’t stop working until they are reunited with their loved ones,\" Blinken said.What Griner's wife says: Cherelle Griner, the wife of WNBA star Brittney Griner, told CNN on Thursday she wants US officials to do whatever they have to do to bring the basketball legend home – and she needs to see them do more.She also said she would “absolutely” like to meet with US President Joe Biden and humanize Brittney to him so he can “see BG as we see BG.”“While everyone wants to tell me they care, I’d love for him to tell me he cares,” she added.Read more from her interview here.

The death toll from Russia's overnight strikes in the Odesa region has risen to 20, Ukraine's emergency services have said.At least 16 people were killed in a residential building, and four more – including one child –were killed in another strike on a recreation center.A third strike landed in a field, authorities said. A rescue operation is ongoing and 38 people were injured in the strikes.Previous updates from Ukrainian authorities suggested two children had been killed.“We don't expect to find anyone alive, but there is a chance,” first deputy interior minister Yevhenii Yenin said earlier on Friday, speaking from the scene of the attacks. From CNN's Oleksandra OchmanFollowing Russia's withdrawal from Snake Island in the Black Sea, Ukraine hopes that strikes on the territory around Odesa will decrease, a spokesman for the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, Andrii Demchenko, said Friday.“It’s now known why the enemy took the island. They filled the territory with the means of destruction and fired from them,” Demchenko said at a briefing. “We hope now shelling of the territory of Ukraine will decrease.”Demchenko went on to say he hoped the Ukrainian border service would be able to return to the island soon.“The situation with Snake Island remains tense as the enemy could have mined the ways to the island. Now the situation is being monitored and investigated,” he explained. “I hope the Ukrainian border guards will return to this piece of Ukrainian land as soon as possible.”From CNN's Radina Gigova in London Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed Western sanctions are pushing Russia and Belarus toward \"speeding up integration\" in various sectors, which he said would \"minimize the damage\" of the sanctions. \"Russia and Belarus continue to grow in their cooperation in the political, trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian spheres,\" Putin said in a video message to the participants of an annual Russia-Belarus forum on Friday\"The unprecedented pressure of sanctions from the so-called collective West is pushing us towards speeding up integration. Together it is easier to minimize the damage from the illegal sanctions, it is easier to set up the production of demanded products, develop new competencies and expand cooperation with friendly countries,\" Putin said. Belarus is a staunch Russian ally and helped facilitate Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February, with some Russian forces entering the country through the Ukrainian-Belarusian border.A number of joint programs between the two nations have already been developed and more are on track for the coming years, Putin said. Areas of cooperation include technological and industrial innovation, finances and transport.Putin said the joint programs were aimed at creating \"equal economic conditions for our countries\" and would \"form a reliable framework for a financial market and transports base.\"His message comes just days before Belarus celebrates its independence from Nazi Germany on July 3, and as Russia and Belarus marked 30 years of diplomatic relations earlier this year. Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.Remains of a missile are seen near a rail station, amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in Kramatorsk, Ukraine April 8, 2022. The writing reads: \"Because of children\". REUTERS/Stringer/File PhotoJuly 1 (Reuters) - As Russia's military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and other lethal weapons, Western nations have responded in part by targeting Russia's defense industry with sanctions. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"war machine.\"But a Reuters examination of companies, executives and investors underpinning Russia's defense sector shows a sizable number of players have yet to pay a price: Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom. In addition, sanctions on Russia's arms makers and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by these NATO allies, with some governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed.Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned by any of those three authorities is Alan Lushnikov, the largest shareholder of Kalashnikov Concern JSC, the original manufacturer of the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters.The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year.The company accounts for 95% of Russia's production of machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and other handheld firearms, and 98% of its handheld military machine guns, according to its website and most recent annual report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by Ukrainian soldiers. The Kalashnikov Concern also produces missiles that can be fired from aircraft or on land.A former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin’s “inner circle.”Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to requests for comment.It’s the same pattern with Almaz-Antey Concern, a Moscow-based defense company specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but CEO Yan Novikov has not been punished.Almaz-Antey’s website displays the motto “Peaceful Sky is Our Profession.” The company makes Kalibr missiles, which Russia’s Ministry of Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military installations. In a statement last month, the ministry said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the Ukrainian military.Reuters was unable to independently verify that claim.Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to the countries that introduced them.\"The Reuters findings come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that current Western sanctions against Russia “are not enough” as Russian troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine’s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks of intense fighting.Putin has portrayed his military’s assault on Ukraine as a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarizing and “denazifying” its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia indefinitely in what it said was a response to “constantly expanding U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures.”U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia's action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\"The Russian invasion has killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of the casualties were caused by the use of “explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” and that the actual number of dead and wounded was likely far higher.The West has levied sanctions on a swath of Russia’s economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access to imported components and generally make it more costly and time-consuming to produce weaponry. Levying sanctions on the people behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain personal. It allows Western nations to go after any mansions, yachts and other offshore wealth of those who supply Russia’s military, and it limits where they can travel abroad.“You’re demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S. military technology. “They feel it very personally. You’re creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the Kremlin,” said Bergmann, now director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based national security think tank.Other companies in Russia’s defense industry identified by Reuters that have not been sanctioned by the United States, EU or UK include the V.A. Degtyarev Plant(ZDEGI.MM), a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military. Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles.The Degtyarev Plant did not respond to a request for comment.Also not sanctioned is the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant, south of Moscow, where “world-famous cartridges” for pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles are produced, according to an archived version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an ammunition manufacturer that calls itself “one of the leading engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia.”Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment.Last month, Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and United States regarding the news agency’s findings that they had failed to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin’s war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain, said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and its allies had levied “the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin’s war machine.” The European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that sanctions have “made it harder for Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons.”On Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters.One of those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key roles in Russia’s weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2 executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its website and annual reports. Artyakov is also the chairman of at least five Russian weapons firms, among them Russian Helicopters JSC, which builds several lines of military helicopters including the Ka-52 \"Alligator,\" some of which have been shot down and documented in Ukraine.He has not been sanctioned by the EU or UK.Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for comment.Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had not been sanctioned.Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to requests for comment.Other firms on Reuters’ list that were sanctioned just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60.PJSC Tupolev and another firm on Reuters’ list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the country’s most advanced missile systems.PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII Signal did not respond to requests for comment.Executives at a host of Russian weapons firms, meanwhile, have largely escaped sanctions from Western authorities.Nearly three months after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price. The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured more than 100 others.The Russian firm JSC Research and Production Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S. Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington, Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM’s chief executive.The three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander Denisov, the CEO of NPO High Precision Systems, KBM’s parent company. High Precision Systems oversees production of a wide range of missiles, artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian troops and outfitted on military helicopters, aircraft, tanks and warships.Sanctions on Russia’s arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the Western allies. The United States and EU have sanctioned High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not.High Precision Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment. KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond to additional questions submitted by Reuters.Europe and the United States have failed to coordinate sanctions even on makers of banned weapons.Since the outset of Russia’s invasion in late February, Western governments and human rights groups have decried its use of cluster munitions: small bombs delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on civilians.Russia used a Uragan – which translates to “Hurricane” – rocket launcher system to fire cluster bombs in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and Ukrainian officials.The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and Production Association Splav, a Russian firm whose systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU. Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions altogether.Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests for comment.It’s much the same for Splav’s parent company, NPK Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by American or European authorities.Techmash and Kochkin did not respond to requests for comment.In a June 10 statement, the European Commission said there is an effort to align sanctions lists “as much as legally possible” among allies to achieve “the maximum cumulative effect of the sanctions with all our like-minded partners.” In cases where the lists do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not currently on the EU’s sanctions list could be added later if there is sufficient evidence.\"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said.One of the highest-profile Russian firms to escape Western sanctions is VSMPO-Avisma Corp(VSMO.MM), which is the world’s largest titanium supplier and 25% owned by Rostec. It supplies Russia’s defense industry, but also counts major Western aerospace companies among its clients.Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and annual reports. That’s no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense experts who spoke with Reuters.VSMPO-Avisma’s vice chairman and majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by Forbes this year as Russia’s 59th-richest person, likewise has not been sanctioned.According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK.VSMPO-Avisma also sells to Europe’s Airbus(AIR.PA), and it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing Co(BA.N) up until March, when the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier “for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes.”VSMPO-Avisma and shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient supply for airplane production.\"Airbus did not answer specific questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium “would massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe” while doing little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of that nation's overall exports.In 2020, foreign sales accounted for about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma’s $1.25 billion in revenue, according to the company’s most recent annual report.That puts Western officials in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk sanctions themselves.“That’s the classic sanctions conundrum: If you want to hurt somebody, you’re going to hurt yourself,” Connolly said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey's veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedTwo children among dead after apartment building and recreation centre struck; Zelenskiy says journey to membership ‘shouldn’t take decades’The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed. A 12-year-old boy was among the dead, he added. Ukraine’s security service had earlier put the death toll at 19. Two children were among the dead and six others among dozens injured, officials said. Authorities also said that 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 people lived.The “very heavy and very powerful” missiles were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, Bratchuk said. He said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The worst-case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odesa region.The Kremlin has denied targeting civilians. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier today. Talina Zharikova first met people who had fled fighting in Donbas in a bomb shelter near her flat in the south-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro when the invasion started. For a while, she and her neighbours hosted them in their flats. But there were quickly more people than they could house, so Zharikova decided to ask about renovating an abandoned Soviet hospital opposite their block of flats.Zharikova, her neighbours, other Dnipro residents and those who had fled fighting set about renovating the building, which had been empty for a decade. There are now 240 people living in the various rooms in the shelter, known as Good on Love, and they say there is room for another 100.The shelter is one of more than 60 set up by Dnipro residents for evacuees. As the first city of relative safety outside many frontline areas, Dnipro has become Ukraine’s aid hub. Thousands who live there, many left jobless by the war, have thrown themselves into volunteering.Like other volunteers in Dnipro, Zharikova said the financial burden has been immense.“The city authorities didn’t help, so I fed them all with my own money for the first month. My husband is fighting at the front and I went out and got out what money I had,” said Zharikova, a former hotel manager.Read the full story by Isobel Koshiw: The informal volunteer groups leading Ukraine’s aid effortA Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reports.The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass.Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports. The cooking of borsch, a beetroot and cabbage soup, in Ukraine has been added to the United Nations cultural agency’s list of endangered heritage because of Russia’s invasion.The Ukrainian culture of cooking borsch, considered a national dish, has been included on Unesco’s “list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding”. Borsch is also widely consumed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland. The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “negative impact on this tradition” caused by the war, Unesco said.“People are unable not only to cook or grow local vegetables for borsch, but also to come together” to eat it, “which undermines the social and cultural well-being of communities”, it said. Ukraine’s minister of culture, Tkachenko Oleksandr, celebrated the decision on Twitter, tweeting: “Victory in the war for borsch is ours!”Перемога у війні за борщ- наша! 🇺🇦Як і всі наступні💪🏻На позачерговому засіданні Міжурядового комітету з охорони нематеріальної культурної спадщини за зверненням @MKIPUkraine “Культура приготування українського борщу” внесено до Списку нематеріальної культурної спадщини @UNESCO pic.twitter.com/iTMNub1ZO1Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, also welcomed Unesco’s decision, saying: “Ukrainian Borsht derussified!”Ukrainian Borsht derussified!At extraordinary meeting @UNESCO Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage unanimously decided to include🇺🇦element \"Culture of Ukrainian borscht cooking\" into the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding1/2 pic.twitter.com/DGHVX6q6eZRussia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, ridiculed the move, claiming “as I understand, everything is subject to Ukrainisation”.Ukraine has requested that Turkey detain and arrest a Russian-flagged cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain, Reuters reports.The ship, Zhibek Zholy, was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” from the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk and headed to Karasu, Turkey, with 7,000 tonnes of cargo, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a letter to Turkey’s justice ministry.Separately, a Ukrainian foreign ministry official said the ship had loaded the first cargo of some 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdiansk, which the official said belonged to Ukraine.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain from occupied areas. The Kremlin has denied that Russia has stolen any Ukrainian grain. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said war in Europe beyond Ukraine is “of course” a possibility and urged countries to support Kyiv.In an interview with CNN, Haavisto was asked if Ukraine can win the war against Russia. He replied:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are, of course, morally on the high ground. They are very united.On Tuesday, Finland, Sweden and Turkey signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later said Finland and Sweden must keep the promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.Earlier today, Haavisto told a news conference that Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during the negotiations at the Nato summit in Madrid earlier this week. Referring to a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Haavisto told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We agreed that now we have a signed text and everything that we have signed is in the text.

I really think that the European security architects [have  been broken. It’s a new situation. There’s a new kind of iron wall between Russia and the other countries. And of course, it’s based on Russia’s aggression against its neighbour Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has changed the security atmosphere”, he added.The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed.

Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he has been forced to take part in “educational activities” including being made to sit for hours under a portrait of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Navalny was transferred last month to a strict-regime penal colony near the town of Vladimir east of Moscow, described by his allies as “one of Russia’s scariest prisons”. In a post on Facebook, he described his life in the new prison where he said he had to sew for seven hours, five days a week. Navalny said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}After work, you continue to sit. For several hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called ‘educational activities’. Even on Sundays, his official day off, he said he was made to sit on a wooden bench in a room for 10 years. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I don’t know who such activities can ‘educate’, except for a crooked invalid with a bad back. But maybe that’s the purpose.Navalny has described his new jail as a “prison within a prison” and said he was serving time with convicted murderers. In a Twitter thread, he compared his prison life to Putin and Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvdev, and said there was a loudspeaker in his barrack that plays songs like “Glory to the FSB”.1/12 I live like Putin and Medvedev.At least I think so when I look at the fence around my barrack. Everyone has the usual fence, and inside there are rods to dry the laundry on.6/12 6:00 - Wake up.

I have as much fun as I can. While sewing, I've memorised Hamlet's monologue in English.Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports have fallen 43% year-on-year to 1.41m tonnes in June, having slumped since the start of the war as its Black Sea ports – the key route for shipments – have been largely closed off.Reuters reports the ministry said farmers in southern and eastern Ukraine had already started the 2022 harvest, threshing 293,800 tonnes of grain from around 1% of the sown area.The government has previously said Ukraine could harvest up to 65m tonnes of grain and oilseeds this year, compared with 106m in 2021, due to the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields.The process of Sweden and Finland joining Nato appears to have some difficulty ahead of it yet. The invitation must be ratified in parliament by all 30 allies, and there still seems to be some conflict between the Nordic countries and Turkey over what was agreed earlier in the week in Madrid. Turkey had threatened to veto their membership bids.Reuters reports that this morning Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during negotiations at the Nato summit.“We agreed that now we have a signed a text and everything that we have signed is in the text,” Haavisto told a news conference in Helsinki. “We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals.”Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said yesterday that Finland and Sweden must keep promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.After four hours of talks in Madrid on Tuesday, Turkey, Finland and Sweden signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships, imposed by Ankara in May due to its concerns about terrorism. The signed memorandum did not list any individuals for extradition.Schools in Kyiv will reopen for classes for the start of the school year on 1 September, the city’s authorities said.Schools in the Ukrainian capital are now on summer holiday after going online when Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. The head of Kyiv’s education and science department, Olena Fidanyan, was cited by AFP as saying that the most important task for the new school year “is the safety of students and teachers”.Territories adjacent to the schools will be checked for explosives and bomb shelters in schools will be restocked with water, medicine and other necessities, she said. All schools will hold “the necessary training with teachers and children on actions during an air-raid alert”, she added.Those children who have not been able to return to Kyiv will be able to study remotely, Fidanyan said.Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff.Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow.Earlier this week, Bulgaria’s prime minister, Kiril Petkov, said his country would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff on espionage concerns. The move was the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats by Sofia in recent years and more than halved the size of Moscow’s diplomatic footprint in Bulgaria.Mitrofanova called the expulsions an “unprecedented hostile” step and on Thursday told Sofia to reverse its decision by midday on Friday.In a statement released by the embassy today, Mitrofanova said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Unfortunately, our appeal to the Bulgarian foreign ministry has been ignored.She added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I intend to quickly put the question of the closure of Russia’s embassy in Bulgaria before my country’s leadership, which will inevitably mean the closure of the Bulgarian diplomatic mission in Moscow.Responsibility for the “grave consequences of this step” will rest with Petkov’s government, Mitrofanova said. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum.The move puts many of them in a difficult position. If they do not sign, they will lose their jobs and be at risk of retaliation from Russian forces. If they sign, there is the risk of charges from Ukrainian authorities, which view teaching the Russian curriculum as a form of collaboration with the enemy.The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine whose identities, for safety reasons, cannot be revealed. They said that around mid-June newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July either to sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign, with many of them being threatened with eviction from their homes.The Russian education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, announced in June that when the new school year began in September all schools in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were to work according to Russian standards.“We will do our best to open schools on 1 September so that they are as ready as possible to function according to Russian standards,” Kravtsov said. “Integration will take place. We are already taking some steps in this direction: teacher training and the supply of textbooks.”One teacher living in a village in the occupied area of Kharkiv said: “At the moment, only history, geography, language and primary schoolteachers were asked to sign the document.”“Math, physics, biology and chemistry curriculum in Russia don’t carry propaganda, so they are left alone, at least for now,” he added.Read the full article by Lorenzo Tondo: Moscow forcing teachers in Ukraine to sign up to Russian curriculumEight people have now been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials.Ukraine’s state emergency service reported late last night that the body of a man was discovered under a collapsed staircase, bringing the total death toll to eight and six wounded. On Wednesday, mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed.\n",

            "        AT LEAST 17 people were killed and dozens wounded today in missile strikes on Ukraine’s Odessa region, a day after Russian troops abandoned positions on a strategic island in a major setback to the Kremlin’s invasion.The news came after Nato leaders wrapped up a summit in Madrid, with US President Joe Biden announcing $800 million in new weapons for Ukraine.“We are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance are going to stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes to make sure they are not defeated by Russia,” he said.But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared surging diplomatic tensions to the Cold War, telling reporters: “As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending… The process has begun.”There was a glimmer of hope however, when Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited Moscow on Thursday after a trip to Kyiv, said he had given Russian President Vladimir Putin a message from their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Neither side has revealed what was in the note.Hours after the summit ended, missiles were fired at an apartment building and recreation centre in the southern region of Odessa, a strategic flashpoint that is home to Ukraine’s historic port city of the same name.The nine-storey apartment building was partially destroyed, leaving 14 people dead and 30 wounded, including several children, the emergency services said.Three people, including a child, were killed and one wounded in the attack on the recreation centre, they said.\n",

            "\n",
            "    Source: AP/PA ImagesThe strikes, in the Bilgorod-Dnistrovsky district, were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, said Odessa military administration spokesman Sergiy Bratchuk.“The worst case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odessa region,” he said in a TV interview, adding they had fired “very heavy and very powerful” missiles.Bratchuk urged people not to post online information about the rescue operation.‘Goodwill gesture’The early Friday strikes came a day after Russian troops abandoned their positions on Snake Island, off the coast of Odessa.The island had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the first days of the war, when the rocky outcrop’s defenders told a Russian warship to “go f*ck yourself” after it called on them to surrender — an incident that spurred a defiant meme.It was also a strategic target, sitting aside shipping lanes near the port of Odessa. Russia had attempted to install missile and air defence batteries while under fire from drones.The decision to abandon Snake Island “changes the situation in the Black Sea considerably,” Zelenskyy said in his daily address yesterday.“It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already considerably limits the actions of the occupiers.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited Snake Island as he warned the Russian president that any eventual peace deal would be on Ukraine’s terms.“We’ve seen what Ukraine can do to drive the Russians back. We’ve seen what they did around Kyiv and Kharkiv, now on Snake Island,” Johnson said.The Russian defence ministry statement described the retreat as “a gesture of goodwill” meant to demonstrate that Moscow will not interfere with UN efforts to organise protected grain exports from Ukraine.But Ukraine officials claimed it as a win.“They always downplay their defeats this way,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.In peacetime, Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter, but Russia’s invasion has damaged farmland and seen Ukraine’s ports seized, razed or blockaded — threatening grain importers in Africa with famine.Western powers have accused Putin of using the trapped harvest as a weapon to increase pressure on the international community, and Russia has been accused of stealing grain.‘Direct threat’Yesterday, a ship carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain sailed from Ukraine’s occupied port of Berdyansk, said the regional leader appointed by the Russian occupation forces.Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Moscow administration, said Russia’s Black Sea ships “are ensuring the security” of the journey, adding that the port had been de-mined.Separately, the Russian defence ministry said its forces are holding more than 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war who have been captured since the February 24 invasion.The conflict in Ukraine dominated the Nato summit in Madrid this week, as the alliance officially invited Sweden and Finland to join, and Biden announced new deployments of US troops, ships and planes to Europe.\n",

            "        Russian missiles continued to rain down elsewhere in Ukraine and a United Nations official said Thursday that 16 million people in Ukraine were in need of humanitarian aid.In the southern city of Mykolaiv, rescuers found the bodies of seven civilians in the rubble of a destroyed building, emergency services said.The city of Lysychansk in the eastern Donbas region — the current focus of Russia’s offensive — is also facing sustained bombardment.The situation in Lysychansk — the last major city the Russians need to take over in the Lugansk region — was “extremely difficult” with relentless shelling making it impossible to evacuate civilians, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said.“There is a lot of shelling… The Russian army is approaching from different directions,” he said in a video posted on Telegram.© AFP 2022To embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n",

            "TheJournal.ie Latest News FeedStrikes in Southern Ukraine leave 17 dead after Russia evacuates Snake Island CommentsCreate an email alert based on the current articleSERHIIVKA, Ukraine, July 1 (Reuters) - Russia flattened part of an apartment building while residents slept on Friday in missile attacks near Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa that authorities say killed at least 21 people, hours after Russian troops abandoned a nearby outpost at Snake Island.Neighbours in the resort village of Serhiivka helped workers comb through the rubble of the nine-storey apartment block, a section of which had been completely destroyed at 1:00 a.m.Walls and windows of a neighbouring, 14-storey apartment block had also been damaged by the blast wave. Nearby holiday camps were also hit.\"We came here to the site, assessed the situation together with emergency workers and locals, and together helped those who survived. And those who unfortunately died. We helped to carry them away,” said Oleksandr Abramov, who lives nearby and had rushed to the scene when he heard the blast.Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa regional administration, said 21 people had been confirmed killed, including a 12-year-old boy. Authorities said earlier 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 lived.The regional governor said the Soviet-era missiles had been fired from the direction of the Black Sea.The Kremlin denied targeting civilians: \"I would like to remind you of the president's words that the Russian Armed Forces do not work with civilian targets,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The attack came just four days after Russia struck a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine killing at least 19 people.Kyiv says Moscow has dramatically escalated its long-range attacks hitting civilian targets far from the front line in recent days, which Ukraine describes as a war crime. Russia says it has been aiming at military sites.Thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Ukraine says is an unprovoked war of aggression. Russia calls the invasion a \"special operation\" to root out nationalists.On Thursday, Russia pulled its troops off Snake Island, a desolate but strategically important outcrop that it seized on the war's first day and had used to control the northwestern Black Sea, where it has blockaded Odesa and other ports.In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed what he described as a strategic victory at Snake Island.\"It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet ensure that the enemy will not come back,\" he said. \"But this significantly limits the actions of the occupiers. Step by step, we will push them back from our sea, our land and our sky.\"Rescue workers work at the scene of a missile strike at a location given as Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa region, Ukraine, in this handout image released July 1, 2022.? State Emergency Services of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERSIn Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmakers gave a standing ovation as the flag of the European Union was carried through the chamber to stand alongside Ukraine's own flag behind the dais, a symbol of Ukraine's formal EU candidate status granted last week.Zelenskiy and the lawmakers also stood for a minute of silence for those killed in the morning attacks near Odesa.Russia's stepped up campaign of long-range missile attacks on Ukrainian cities has come as its forces have ground out success on the battlefield in the east, with a relentless assault to force Kyiv to cede two provinces to separatists.Moscow has been on the verge of capturing one of those provinces, Luhansk, since taking the city of Sievierodonetsk last week after some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Ukraine's last bastion in Luhansk is the city of Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets river, which is close to being encircled under relentless Russian artillery assault.The Russians were shelling Lysychansk from different directions and approaching from several sides, regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Ukrainian television.\"The superiority in fire power of the occupiers is still very much in evidence,\" Zelenskiy said. \"They have simply brought in all their reserves to hit us.\"In Russian-occupied Sievierodonetsk, residents have emerged from basements to sift through the rubble of their city.\"Almost all the city infrastructure is destroyed. We are living without gas, electricity, and water since May,\" Sergei Oleinik, 65, told Reuters. \"We are glad that this ended, and soon maybe reconstruction will start, and we will be back to more or less normal life.\"But after its losses in the east, the Ukrainian victory at Snake Island gives Kyiv a major success in the Black Sea. The island has been a national symbol since the first day of the war when a Ukrainian guard ordered by Russia to surrender radioed back: \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself.\"Russia has used its control of the sea to impose a blockade on Ukraine, one of the world's biggest grain exporters, threatening to shatter Ukraine's economy and cause global famine.Moscow denies it is to blame for a food crisis, which it says is caused by Western sanctions hurting its own exports. President Vladimir Putin met the president of Indonesia on Thursday and spoke by phone on Friday to the prime minister of India, promising both major food importers that Russia would remain a big supplier of grain.Pushing the Russians off Snake Island could be a step towards reopening Odesa's port, although military analysts say Russia could still threaten cargo ships at sea.Ukraine hopes to inflict enough damage in the east to exhaust Russia's advancing army, and turn the tide in coming months with advanced weapons arriving from the West.In the latest sign of Russia's split with Europe, Russia's ambassador in Bulgaria said she would call for her embassy to be shut, along with Bulgaria's embassy in Moscow, following Sofia's refusal to reinstate diplomats it expelled for spying.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey's veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedAt least 19 dead after Russian missile strikes multi-story apartment building in Odesa; Russian forces withdraw from Snake Island in Black SeaAt least 19 people, including two children, have been confirmed dead after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries, Ukraine’s security service said. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. Speaking at the scene, Yenin said rescue operations were ongoing but “we don’t expect to find anyone alive”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Peskov told reporters.Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said “There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union.”Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. He said “Our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.”Ukrainian forces said Thursday they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes.The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.”Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said on Thursday. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference.A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk on Thursday for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying.Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible.Joe Biden declared that the US and Nato allies will stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” as the military alliance promised hundreds of thousands more troops to defend eastern Europe. The US president also announced on Thursday another $800m of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained over how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack.Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday. After the Nato summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said leaders had decided to support Kyiv “to make sure Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state in Europe”.Turkey’s president has warned that Ankara could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that if the two Nordic countries reneged on their promises, including to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday.Estonian and Latvian defence ministers signed a letter of intent on Thursday at the Nato summit in Madrid for joint procurement of medium-range anti-aircraft systems.“The aggression of Russia in Ukraine clearly shows the need for air defence systems,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a statement.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would deliver six Caesar howitzers and a “significant number” of armoured vehicles to Ukraine. He added that the Nato allies meeting in Madrid “unanimously decided” to boost humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Asked whether the British government believed Russia could be pushed out of all of Ukraine within a foreseeable timeframe, Truss replied: “It is realistic, and that is why we are supplying the extra lethal aid we’re supplying.”Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, to protest against Boris Johnson’s “offensive” remarks regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”, it said in a statement.Norway’s foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday, Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Huitfeldt said Norway was not blocking Russian access to the Arctic archipelago, only applying international sanctions, and that Russia had other means to reach its settlements.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Moscow on Thursday, where he will urge Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire and seek ways to allow the export of grain from Ukraine. Widodo also met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday during a visit he described as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine”.{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}“We are fighting for our country and Western values,” explain Ukrainians. “And we won’t stop.”More than anything, it is this sense of patriotism and resourcefulness – and a little bit of help from Ukraine’s friends – that is likely to determine the war’s outcome. The British spy George Blake, who defected to the Soviet Union, said just before his death in 2020 that spies now have “the difficult and critical mission” of saving the world “in a situation when the danger of nuclear war and the resulting self-destruction of humankind again have been put on the agenda by irresponsible politicians. It’s a true battle between good and evil.”Blake, who went over to the Russian side while a prisoner during the Korean War, may have inadvertently been describing Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible assault on Ukraine. Unless the Russian leader wanted another Cold War, he has (so far) failed dramatically in strategic terms: first, in his aim to “liberate” Ukrainians from their government, and second, to curtail Nato’s enlargement. With Finland and Sweden joining, he now has a much larger Nato on his borders – a 1,340km longer Nato, to be precise. He has ignited a fierce Ukrainian patriotism. I have driven through more than 3,500km of Ukraine north to south over the past three months: there is scarcely a building without Ukrainian flags, banners, posters and painted walls. How might this war end?The presence of such nationalism, shaped by the anvil of conflict and genocide under the Holodomor perpetrated by Stalin in the 1930s – in which millions of Ukrainians died of starvation due to the confiscation of their wheat – reduces the scenario options. Those scenarios, which have Russia maintaining control over all or some of the roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory now occupied, can only be temporary – the conflict frozen, but unresolved. The challenge for Ukraine is not only in stopping Russia grinding out its advances – for which heavier precision Western weaponry is required – but finding the means to remove them. Unlike Russia, which has simply destroyed the cities targeted, such as Mariupol and now Severodonetsk, Ukraine’s counterattacks have to be tactically more astute and avoid civilian damage and casualties – it’s their own people and country, after all. This outcome is not entirely down to Nato assistance, of course, but depends also on Russia’s economic and military strength. The signs are not hopeful, given the claimed Russian military losses – 30,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, 2,500 armoured vehicles, more than 500 aircraft and 600 drones – which are expensive and time-consuming to replace, not least because of the skills required. This will test the Russian economy, even if you believe the Russian media’s claim that it’s thriving due to a higher oil price. At between $2-million and $5-million a pop for a tank, and at least 15 times for a fighter aircraft, war is expensive – and that is before Western sanctions begin to bite, which they will by the end of this year when Europe has committed to cut off Russian oil imports, a principal export earner.   To some extent, the outcome depends on how the region works with Ukraine to get its trade routes for its commodities back up and running, including through Moldova, Romania and Poland especially. It will also rely on what the world has learnt from Putin. There will inevitably be those who call for appeasement, even though the record of feeding such authoritarians chunks of other people’s territory is seldom a formula for a durable peace. Until now, Putin has successfully portrayed himself as a man who will stop at nothing, an irrational actor – “a monkey with a grenade”. But this is a tactic designed to keep the West guessing at his unpredictability, especially over the use of nuclear weapons. Equally, when Russia decides to disengage – such as it did in redeploying its forces from around Kyiv in April or more recently from Snake Island – there was no monkeying around in the orderly and efficient withdrawal.  But the West, too, possesses nuclear weapons. Deterrence is as much about politics, staying power and signalling as it is about hardware. Nato’s problems have stemmed from its disparate organisational and political complement, though for now the differences in approach between its members are smaller than at any time in the post-Cold War order.  And to the greatest extent, the outcome depends on the extent of Ukrainian fighting spirit and political will. For the moment, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s approval ratings are over 80%. Whether this support will flag the longer the war drags on and the costs mount, or whether Ukrainians will further harden their position towards Russia as a consequence, remains to be seen. For now, most Ukrainians are not interested in compromise. They demand compensation and justice. It seems that this war will not end – conventionally or through a long-term insurgency – without a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. Those terms are, after all, what most countries would expect. The human cost of the conflict thus makes a deal trading land for peace politically very difficult for Zelensky, no matter his obvious skills. After all, it is Ukraine that has been invaded. The recent history of eastern and central Europe suggests that this occupation will, no matter the Russian propaganda, be bloody but temporary.

Western commentators said on Thursday (June 30) that the retreat of the Russians marks a major setback, and likely weakens their control over shipping routes that are key to Moscow’s strategic objectives.Last week Ukraine had said it had caused “significant losses” to Russia in airstrikes on the island. That hit was believed to be the second major military success using missiles given to the regime in Kyiv by the West.The Ukrainians had earlier claimed a first successful use of Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Reuters had reported, quoting British Military Intelligence.Both Moscow and Kyiv confirmed the Russian retreat. The Ukrainians said the Russians had caved in to sustained targeting of the island and Russian supply lines by missiles and artillery fire for more than a week.The last Russian soldiers had left on two speedboats during the night, the Ukrainian military said. “There are no more Russians on Zmiinyi (the Ukrainian name for the island),” The New York Times quoted Andrii Yermak, the head of the presidential office of Ukraine, as saying.The Ukrainian military had said on Tuesday (June 28) that it had destroyed three anti-aircraft missile systems that were recently installed by the Russians on the island. The radar had been knocked out, as a result of which Russia could no longer assist its soldiers on the island.The Russian defence ministry too said it had left the island, but sought to paint it as “a gesture of goodwill” that would “not allow Kyiv to speculate on the impending food crisis”, The NYT report said.Russian warships and submarines in the Black Sea have blocked Ukrainian grain exports, which averaged 5 million tonnes per month before the war. The crucial port of Odessa in the western Black Sea is still under Ukrainian control, but Western analysts were saying the Russian withdrawal from Snake Island did not necessarily mean traffic from the port would be more secure against Russian attacks.Snake or Serpent Island, called Zmiinyi in Ukrainian, is a rocky outcrop that extends less than 700 metres from end to end, and is often described as being “X-shaped”. It is located 35 km from the coast, to the east of the mouth of the Danube and roughly southwest of Odessa.The island has been known since ancient times. Tales about it go back to the mythological Trojan war, Reuters reported. It has a long association with Achilles, the mythical Greek warrior who was invincible but for his vulnerable heel.Today, the island is marked on the map by the tiny village of Bile that is located on it. The island is close to the coast of Romania, with which Ukraine has had a dispute — and which was settled in 2009 by the International Court of Justice, which drew a new maritime border between the two countries, a Reuters report said. Parts of the Black Sea around Snake Island are believed to hold significant oil and gas reserves.On February 24, the day Russia launched its invasion, two warships from the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Vasily Bykov and Moskva, attacked Snake Island, followed by Russian troops landing on it. A Ukrainian soldier’s salty response — “Russian warship, go f**k yourself” — quickly became the stuff of war legend. Ukraine issued a postage stamp celebrating his defiance, and in April, destroyed the Moskva, the 600-foot flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which had attacked the island on day 1 of the war.Newsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) for the latest news and updatesFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App.\n"

The Philippines was one of 160 countries that signed the United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s February 24 invasion of Ukraine, but it has so far continued to engage Moscow diplomatically. \\xa0The Russian sources asserted that Kyiv is deliberately blocking the Black Sea and continues to evade the liberation of its controlled harbors in the sealane.\\xa0 \\xa0In contrast, sources claimed that Russia has completed the de-mining of Berdyansk and Mariupol ports to ensure the safe passage of ships, especially those carrying grains that other countries need.\\xa0Russia and Ukraine have been accusing each other over who is to blame for the late deliveries of cargo due to the mined sea routes. Food prices have already spiked, leading to inflationary spirals that have affected many countries that include the Philippines.\\xa0 \\xa0In early June, a UN alert was cited in a Bloomberg report as saying that the Pinoy seafarers account for a third of the 450 sailors trapped in 80 ships stranded near the Black Sea ports.

No country should be left alone against this evil and I\\'m grateful to Norway,\" Zelensky continued, highlighting how the country supported Ukraine \"straight away.\"\\xa0From CNN\\'s Jonny Hallam and Cristiana MoisescuIn the aftermath of Russia\\'s early morning missile strikes on a residential area near Odesa in southern Ukraine, Moldova\\'s Minister of Health Ala Nemerenco has said one of the buildings struck in the attack was a rehabilitation center for treating Moldovan children with health problems.In a statement on Facebook,\\xa0Nemerenco said\\xa0that although the building itself was not badly damaged, with only windows smashed in part of the building, one employee was killed and five were injured following the strike.\\xa0The Moldovan-owned rehabilitation center\\xa0gave \"children with health problems in the Republic of Moldova the opportunity to benefit from medical rehabilitation services on the Black Sea coast,\"\\xa0Nemerenco\\xa0said.Nemerenco\\xa0paid tribute to the facilities\\' medical staff who were injured and killed in the Russian bombardment.The center had been closed to patients since the start of the coronavirus pandemic,\\xa0said Nemerenco.\\xa0No children are thought to have been at the center at the time of the attack.After Finland was formally invited to join the NATO this week, Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto spoke to CNN about the new world order where Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbor Russia becomes a security threat.Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine \"has changed the\\xa0security atmosphere,\" he added.Pekka also said there are concerns about \"the loose talks about the nuclear weapons, the chemical weapons,\" leading the world back to the Cuba missile crisis during the Cold War.\"Yes we have a strong traditional\\xa0military.\\xa0We have our F-35s coming and so\\xa0forth.\\xa0But what if we\\'re threatened by unconventional weapons?\" Pekka said about Finland\\'s security concerns.Finland Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told CNN that \"of course\" war in Europe beyond Ukraine is a possibility. Following decades of neutrality, Finland — along with Sweden — was formally invited to join NATO this week during the alliance\\'s summit in Madrid, marking a historic expansion of the defense bloc that directly undercuts Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s aims as his war in Ukraine grinds ahead.The group collectively decided to approve countries\\' applications to join after Turkey dropped its objections Tuesday, paving the way for NATO\\'s most consequential enlargement in decades.\\xa0The decision will now go to the 30 member states\\' parliaments and legislatures for final ratification. NATO\\'s leaders said they expected the process to move quickly, allowing for an unprecedentedly swift accession and a show of unity against Putin.When asked if Ukraine can win the war, Haavisto said, \"They can maintain the situation\\xa0and in that sense, they can win\\xa0this battle.\\xa0I think they are of course morally on the\\xa0high ground.\\xa0They are very united.\"\"They need our support,\" he added.

The prosecution believes that then Griner had the intention to import the drugs into Russia\\'s territory and put the prohibited substances into a backpack and a suitcase, according to TASS.The Phoenix Mercury star plays in Russia during the WNBA’s off-season and was arrested at a Moscow airport a week before Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. When Griner arrived on a flight from New York to Moscow\\'s Sheremetyevo airport on Feb. 17, \"two cartridges of hashish oil were found in her hand luggage during an inspection,\" according to TASS.Cannabis oil is subject to control on the territory of the Russian Federation and is classified as narcotic drugs, according to TASS.\\xa0The offense\\xa0of smuggling significant amounts of a narcotic substance is punishable by up to 10 years in prison in Russia.\\xa0US Embassy Charge d’Affaires Elizabeth Rood said she was able to speak with Griner inside the courtroom and that the US government is working \"very hard\" to bring Griner and other \"wrongfully detained citizens\" safely home.\\xa0Griner’s lawyers, Alexander Boykov and Maria Blagovolina, said they were unaware of any plans to exchange Griner for a Russian prisoner held in the US in an impromptu presser at the end of the first day of her trial.\\xa0The court will continue to hear the case next week on July 7 at 2:30 p.m. local time.Later on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that officials from the US embassy in Russia \"attended Brittney Griner’s trial today in Moscow.\"\"We – and I personally – have no higher priority than bringing her and other wrongfully detained Americans, including Paul Whelan, home,\" he said in a tweet Friday, referencing another unlawfully detained American there.\"We won’t stop working until they are reunited with their loved ones,\" Blinken said.What Griner\\'s wife says: Cherelle Griner, the wife of WNBA star\\xa0Brittney Griner, told CNN on Thursday she wants US officials to do whatever they have to do to bring the basketball legend home – and she needs to see them do more.She also said she would “absolutely” like to meet with US President Joe Biden and humanize Brittney to him so he can “see BG as we see BG.”“While everyone wants to tell me they care, I’d love for him to tell me he cares,” she added.Read more from her interview here.

The death toll from Russia\\'s overnight strikes in the Odesa region has risen to 20, Ukraine\\'s emergency services have said.At least 16 people were killed in a residential building, and four more – including one child –were killed in another strike on a recreation center.A third strike landed in a field, authorities said. A rescue operation is ongoing and 38 people were injured in the strikes.Previous updates from Ukrainian authorities suggested two children had been killed.“We don\\'t expect to find anyone alive, but there is a chance,” first deputy interior minister Yevhenii Yenin said earlier on Friday, speaking from the scene of the attacks. From CNN\\'s Oleksandra OchmanFollowing Russia\\'s withdrawal from Snake Island in the Black Sea, Ukraine hopes that strikes on the territory around Odesa will decrease, a spokesman for the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine, Andrii Demchenko, said Friday.“It’s now known why the enemy took the island. They filled the territory with the means of destruction and fired from them,” Demchenko said at a briefing. “We hope now shelling of the territory of Ukraine will decrease.”Demchenko went on to say he hoped the Ukrainian border service would be able to return to the island soon.“The situation with Snake Island remains tense as the enemy could have mined the ways to the island.

The writing reads: \"Because of children\". REUTERS/Stringer/File PhotoJuly 1 (Reuters) - As Russia\\'s military continues to pound Ukraine with missiles and other lethal weapons, Western nations have responded in part by targeting Russia\\'s defense industry with sanctions. The latest round came on Tuesday, when the United States issued new sanctions on some arms makers and executives at the heart of what it dubbed Russian President Vladimir Putin\\'s \"war machine.\"But a Reuters examination of companies, executives and investors underpinning Russia\\'s defense sector shows a sizable number of players have yet to pay a price: Nearly three dozen leaders of Russian weapons firms and at least 14 defense companies have not been sanctioned by the United States, the European Union or the United Kingdom. In addition, sanctions on Russia\\'s arms makers and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by these NATO allies, with some governments levying penalties and others not, the Reuters review showed.Among the weapons moguls who have not been sanctioned by any of those three authorities is Alan Lushnikov, the largest shareholder of Kalashnikov Concern JSC, the original manufacturer of the well-known AK-47 assault rifle. Lushnikov owns a 75% stake in the firm, according to the most recent business records reviewed by Reuters.The company itself was sanctioned by the United States in 2014, the year Russia invaded and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. The EU and UK leveled their own sanctions against Kalashnikov Concern this year.The company accounts for 95% of Russia\\'s production of machine guns, sniper rifles, pistols and other handheld firearms, and 98% of its handheld military machine guns, according to its website and most recent annual report. Its weapons include the AK-12 assault rifle, an updated version of the AK-47, some of which have been captured from Russian forces by Ukrainian soldiers. The Kalashnikov Concern also produces missiles that can be fired from aircraft or on land.A former Russian deputy transport minister, Lushnikov once worked for commodities tycoon Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. The United States sanctioned Timchenko in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Crimea, naming him as a member of the Kremlin’s “inner circle.”Neither Lushnikov, Timchenko or the Kalashnikov Concern responded to requests for comment.It’s the same pattern with Almaz-Antey Concern, a Moscow-based defense company specializing in missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK, but CEO Yan Novikov has not been punished.Almaz-Antey’s website displays the motto “Peaceful Sky is Our Profession.” The company makes Kalibr missiles, which Russia’s Ministry of Defense has credited with destroying Ukrainian military installations. In a statement last month, the ministry said Russia had fired long-range Kalibr missiles at a Ukrainian command post near the village of Shyroka Dacha in eastern Ukraine, killing what the ministry claimed were more than 50 generals and officers of the Ukrainian military.Reuters was unable to independently verify that claim.Neither Almaz-Antey nor CEO Novikov responded to requests for comment.In response to a list of questions submitted by Reuters about Western sanctions aimed at Russia, a Kremlin spokesperson said \"the consistency and logic of imposing sanctions, as well as the legality of imposing such restrictions, is a question that should be put directly to the countries that introduced them.\"The Reuters findings come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that current Western sanctions against Russia “are not enough” as Russian troops make gains in their assault on Ukraine’s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Ukrainian military has been outgunned by Russian artillery in places such as the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk, which it ceded to Russian forces last week after weeks of intense fighting.Putin has portrayed his military’s assault on Ukraine as a “special military operation” aimed at demilitarizing and “denazifying” its democratic neighbor. On Tuesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry announced it would bar Jill Biden and Ashley Biden, the wife and daughter of U.S. President Joe Biden, from entering Russia indefinitely in what it said was a response to “constantly expanding U.S. sanctions against Russian politicians and public figures.”U.S. National Security advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday that Russia\\'s action was not surprising because \"the Russian capacity for these kinds of cynical moves is basically bottomless.\"The Russian invasion has killed thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians, but the exact number is unknown. The United Nations human rights office said, as of Monday, that 4,731 civilians had been killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24, including more than 300 children, with another 5,900 civilians injured in the conflict. The agency said most of the casualties were caused by the use of “explosive weapons with a wide impact area, including shelling from heavy artillery and multiple launch rocket systems, and missile and air strikes,” and that the actual number of dead and wounded was likely far higher.The West has levied sanctions on a swath of Russia’s economy to punish Moscow, an effort that so far has done little to deter the Russian offensive. Like the bans on other Russian firms, sanctions on weapons companies are meant to hamper their ability to sell to foreign customers. These penalties limit their access to imported components and generally make it more costly and time-consuming to produce weaponry. Levying sanctions on the people behind those firms goes a step further to make the pain personal. It allows Western nations to go after any mansions, yachts and other offshore wealth of those who supply Russia’s military, and it limits where they can travel abroad.“You’re demonstrating that being a regime collaborator comes with a cost,” said Max Bergmann, a former State Department official during the Obama administration who worked on U.S. arms transfers and safeguarding U.S. military technology. “They feel it very personally. You’re creating a disgruntled class of people that are tied to the Kremlin,” said Bergmann, now director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based national security think tank.Other companies in Russia’s defense industry identified by Reuters that have not been sanctioned by the United States, EU or UK include the V.A. Degtyarev Plant(ZDEGI.MM), a facility 165 miles northeast of Moscow that makes machine guns, anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons that are sold to the Russian military. Its weapons include the Kalashnikov PKM and PKTM machine guns, as well as Kord rifles and machine guns, some of which are mounted on armored vehicles.The Degtyarev Plant did not respond to a request for comment.Also not sanctioned is the Klimovsk Specialized Ammunition Plant, south of Moscow, where “world-famous cartridges” for pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles are produced, according to an archived version of its website. Neither is the Novosibirsk Cartridge Plant, an ammunition manufacturer that calls itself “one of the leading engineering enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia.”Neither ammunition plant responded to requests for comment.Last month, Reuters sought comments from sanctions officials in the UK, EU and United States regarding the news agency’s findings that they had failed to punish a raft of Russian defense firms and tycoons fueling Putin’s war effort. As part of that process, Reuters provided those Western authorities with a detailed list of more than 20 companies and more than three-dozen people that had escaped sanctions.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, which levies sanctions for Britain, said it could not comment on future sanctions. It added that London and its allies had levied “the largest and most severe economic sanctions that Russia has ever faced, to help cripple Putin’s war machine.” The European Commission and the U.S. Treasury Department, which handle sanctions for Brussels and Washington respectively, declined to comment on the specifics of Reuters’ findings. Elizabeth Rosenberg, assistant secretary for terrorist financing and financial crimes at the Treasury Department, said in a statement that sanctions have “made it harder for Russia to obtain what it needs to procure and produce weapons.”On Tuesday, in conjunction with a meeting of leaders of the G7 nations in the German Alps, the Treasury Department released a new round of defense-related sanctions that included eight of the weapons firms and two of the executives on the list provided earlier by Reuters.One of those newly sanctioned executives, Vladimir Artyakov, has played key roles in Russia’s weapons industry for decades, and serves as the No. 2 executive at Rostec, a military-industrial giant with hundreds of subsidiaries employing more than half a million people, according to its website and annual reports. Artyakov is also the chairman of at least five Russian weapons firms, among them Russian Helicopters JSC, which builds several lines of military helicopters including the Ka-52 \"Alligator,\" some of which have been shot down and documented in Ukraine.He has not been sanctioned by the EU or UK.Artyakov and Russian Helicopters did not respond to requests for comment.Rostec has been sanctioned by Washington since 2014. On Tuesday the United States targeted the company again, levying sanctions on more than 40 Rostec subsidiaries and affiliates. Among those hit was Avtomatika Concern, a company linked to cyber warfare. It was on the list of Russian defense firms that Reuters had submitted to the Treasury Department last month seeking an explanation as to why the companies had not been sanctioned.Rostec and Avtomatika Concern did not respond to requests for comment.Other firms on Reuters’ list that were sanctioned just this week by the Treasury Department include PJSC Tupolev, a maker of fighter jets such as the Tu-22M3 bomber. The Ukrainian military said Tu-22M3 bombers were responsible for a missile strike at a crowded shopping center in the central Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk on Monday, which killed at least 18 people and injured about 60.PJSC Tupolev and another firm on Reuters’ list, JSC VNII Signal, have not been sanctioned by the EU or UK. JSC VNII Signal is a producer of mechanical and navigational systems that power Russian military tanks and some of the country’s most advanced missile systems.PJSC Tupolev and JSC VNII Signal did not respond to requests for comment.Executives at a host of Russian weapons firms, meanwhile, have largely escaped sanctions from Western authorities.Nearly three months after a Tochka-U ballistic missile hit a train station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk on April 8, Russian weapons executives linked to the company that makes those missiles have yet to pay a price. The strike killed more than 50 people, including children, and injured more than 100 others.The Russian firm JSC Research and Production Corporation Konstruktorskoye Byuro Mashynostroyeniya, known as KBM, has been the primary manufacturer of Tochka-U missiles, according to a U.S. Army database of worldwide military equipment. Neither Washington, Brussels or London have sanctioned Sergey Pitikov, KBM’s chief executive.The three Western allies have likewise spared Alexander Denisov, the CEO of NPO High Precision Systems, KBM’s parent company. High Precision Systems oversees production of a wide range of missiles, artillery, grenade launchers and machine guns used by Russian troops and outfitted on military helicopters, aircraft, tanks and warships.Sanctions on Russia’s arms companies and tycoons have been applied inconsistently by the Western allies. The United States and EU have sanctioned High Precision Systems, for example, while the UK has not. The United States has sanctioned KBM, but the EU and UK have not.High Precision Systems, Pitikov and Denisov did not respond to requests for comment. KBM confirmed that Pitikov is its chief executive, but did not respond to additional questions submitted by Reuters.Europe and the United States have failed to coordinate sanctions even on makers of banned weapons.Since the outset of Russia’s invasion in late February, Western governments and human rights groups have decried its use of cluster munitions: small bombs delivered by missiles or rockets, which scatter and explode over an area as large as a city block. A 2008 international treaty bans their use or production under any circumstances because of the devastating effects on civilians.Russia used a Uragan – which translates to “Hurricane” – rocket launcher system to fire cluster bombs in Kharkiv on March 24, killing eight civilians and injuring 15 others, according to the U.N. human rights office and Ukrainian officials.The Uragan is made by JSC Scientific and Production Association Splav, a Russian firm whose systems have been sold abroad to countries including India. The company has been sanctioned by the United States, but not by the UK or EU. Its CEO, Alexander Smirnov, has escaped sanctions altogether.Splav and Smirnov did not respond to requests for comment.It’s much the same for Splav’s parent company, NPK Techmash. The United States and the EU have sanctioned the firm, but the UK has not. Techmash CEO Alexander Kochkin has not been targeted by American or European authorities.Techmash and Kochkin did not respond to requests for comment.In a June 10 statement, the European Commission said there is an effort to align sanctions lists “as much as legally possible” among allies to achieve “the maximum cumulative effect of the sanctions with all our like-minded partners.” In cases where the lists do not align, the Commission statement said, people and companies not currently on the EU’s sanctions list could be added later if there is sufficient evidence.\"Nothing is off the table,\" the statement said.One of the highest-profile Russian firms to escape Western sanctions is VSMPO-Avisma Corp(VSMO.MM), which is the world’s largest titanium supplier and 25% owned by Rostec. It supplies Russia’s defense industry, but also counts major Western aerospace companies among its clients.Based in Verkhnyaya Salda, in central Russia, VSMPO-Avisma has subsidiaries with facilities in the United States, Switzerland and the UK, as well as sales and distribution staff in the United States, Europe and Asia, according to its website and annual reports. That’s no doubt a factor that has allowed the company to escape punishment, according to three sanctions and Russian defense experts who spoke with Reuters.VSMPO-Avisma’s vice chairman and majority shareholder, Russian billionaire Mikhail Shelkov, ranked by Forbes this year as Russia’s 59th-richest person, likewise has not been sanctioned.According to past press releases, VSMPO-Avisma has long-term contracts to supply titanium to United Aircraft Corp, a Rostec subsidiary that oversees production of Russian fighter jets such as the Su-34 that have been shot down in Ukraine. United Aircraft has been sanctioned by the United States, EU and UK.VSMPO-Avisma also sells to Europe’s Airbus(AIR.PA), and it supplied U.S. aerospace behemoth Boeing Co(BA.N) up until March, when the Arlington, Virginia-based company said it stopped purchasing titanium from Russia. Boeing had announced just months earlier, in November 2021, that VSMPO-Avisma would be its largest titanium supplier “for current and future Boeing commercial airplanes.”VSMPO-Avisma and shareholder Shelkov declined to comment. Boeing said in a statement that it has worked since 2014 to diversify its sources of titanium around the world, and that its current inventory and sources \"provide sufficient supply for airplane production.\"Airbus did not answer specific questions about its relationship with VSMPO-Avisma. But in an emailed statement it said potential sanctions on Russian titanium “would massively damage the entire aerospace industry in Europe” while doing little to harm Russia because those sales are but a small portion of that nation\\'s overall exports.In 2020, foreign sales accounted for about two-thirds of VSMPO-Avisma’s $1.25 billion in revenue, according to the company’s most recent annual report.That puts Western officials in a tough spot, said Richard Connolly, director of Eastern Advisory Group, a UK consultancy that advises governments and businesses on the Russian economy and its defense industry. Slapping sanctions on VSMPO-Avisma would curtail its lucrative export trade, but it would also force major players in global aviation to switch suppliers or risk sanctions themselves.“That’s the classic sanctions conundrum: If you want to hurt somebody, you’re going to hurt yourself,” Connolly said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey\\'s veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedTwo children among dead after apartment building and recreation centre struck; Zelenskiy says journey to membership ‘shouldn’t take decades’The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed. A 12-year-old boy was among the dead, he added. Ukraine’s security service had earlier put the death toll at 19. Two children were among the dead and six others among dozens injured, officials said. Authorities also said that 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 people lived.The “very heavy and very powerful” missiles were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, Bratchuk said. He said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}The worst-case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odesa region.The Kremlin has denied targeting civilians. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier today. Talina Zharikova first met people who had fled fighting in Donbas in a bomb shelter near her flat in the south-central Ukrainian city of Dnipro when the invasion started. For a while, she and her neighbours hosted them in their flats. But there were quickly more people than they could house, so Zharikova decided to ask about renovating an abandoned Soviet hospital opposite their block of flats.Zharikova, her neighbours, other Dnipro residents and those who had fled fighting set about renovating the building, which had been empty for a decade. There are now 240 people living in the various rooms in the shelter, known as Good on Love, and they say there is room for another 100.The shelter is one of more than 60 set up by Dnipro residents for evacuees. As the first city of relative safety outside many frontline areas, Dnipro has become Ukraine’s aid hub. Thousands who live there, many left jobless by the war, have thrown themselves into volunteering.Like other volunteers in Dnipro, Zharikova said the financial burden has been immense.“The city authorities didn’t help, so I fed them all with my own money for the first month. My husband is fighting at the front and I went out and got out what money I had,” said Zharikova, a former hotel manager.Read the full story by Isobel Koshiw: The informal volunteer groups leading Ukraine’s aid effortA Briton and a Moroccan man sentenced to death by pro-Russia officials in Russian-controlled east Ukraine have appealed against their sentences, Russian state media reports.The supreme court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has received appeals from lawyers for Brahim Saadoun and Shaun Pinner, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass.Another Briton sentenced to death by the Russian proxy court, Aiden Aslin, had not yet submitted an appeal, Tass reports. The cooking of borsch, a beetroot and cabbage soup, in Ukraine has been added to the United Nations cultural agency’s list of endangered heritage because of Russia’s invasion.The Ukrainian culture of cooking borsch, considered a national dish, has been included on Unesco’s “list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding”. Borsch is also widely consumed in Russia, other ex-Soviet countries and Poland. The decision was approved after a fast-track process prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the “negative impact on this tradition” caused by the war, Unesco said.“People are unable not only to cook or grow local vegetables for borsch, but also to come together” to eat it, “which undermines the social and cultural well-being of communities”, it said. Ukraine’s minister of culture, Tkachenko Oleksandr, celebrated the decision on Twitter, tweeting: “Victory in the war for borsch is ours!”Перемога у війні за борщ- наша! 🇺🇦Як і всі наступні💪🏻На позачерговому засіданні Міжурядового комітету з охорони нематеріальної культурної спадщини за зверненням @MKIPUkraine “Культура приготування українського борщу” внесено до Списку нематеріальної культурної спадщини @UNESCO pic.twitter.com/iTMNub1ZO1Ukraine’s first deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzheppar, also welcomed Unesco’s decision, saying: “Ukrainian Borsht derussified!”Ukrainian Borsht derussified!At extraordinary meeting @UNESCO Committee for Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage unanimously decided to include🇺🇦element \"Culture of Ukrainian borscht cooking\" into the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding1/2 pic.twitter.com/DGHVX6q6eZRussia’s foreign ministry, Maria Zakharova, ridiculed the move, claiming “as I understand, everything is subject to Ukrainisation”.Ukraine has requested that Turkey detain and arrest a Russian-flagged cargo ship carrying Ukrainian grain, Reuters reports.The ship, Zhibek Zholy, was involved in the “illegal export of Ukrainian grain” from the Russian-occupied port of Berdiansk and headed to Karasu, Turkey, with 7,000 tonnes of cargo, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said in a letter to Turkey’s justice ministry.Separately, a Ukrainian foreign ministry official said the ship had loaded the first cargo of some 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdiansk, which the official said belonged to Ukraine.Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of stealing grain from occupied areas. The Kremlin has denied that Russia has stolen any Ukrainian grain. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has said war in Europe beyond Ukraine is “of course” a possibility and urged countries to support Kyiv.In an interview with CNN, Haavisto was asked if Ukraine can win the war against Russia. He replied:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}They can maintain the situation and in that sense, they can win this battle. I think they are, of course, morally on the high ground. They are very united.On Tuesday, Finland, Sweden and Turkey signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later said Finland and Sweden must keep the promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.Earlier today, Haavisto told a news conference that Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during the negotiations at the Nato summit in Madrid earlier this week. Referring to a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Haavisto told reporters:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}We agreed that now we have a signed text and everything that we have signed is in the text. We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals or any listings [with Turkey .Haavisto told CNN that Finland could not maintain neutrality as its neighbour Russia becomes a security threat.Haavisto said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I think it’s a new reality. I really think that the European security architects [have  been broken. It’s a new situation. There’s a new kind of iron wall between Russia and the other countries. And of course, it’s based on Russia’s aggression against its neighbour Ukraine.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has changed the security atmosphere”, he added.The number of people killed in overnight Russian missile strikes on a residential building and resorts in Odesa has risen to at least 21, according to local authorities.Odesa’s military spokesperson, Sergei Bratchuk, told Ukrainian television that 21 people had been confirmed killed.

Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said he has been forced to take part in “educational activities” including being made to sit for hours under a portrait of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.Navalny was transferred last month to a strict-regime penal colony near the town of Vladimir east of Moscow, described by his allies as “one of Russia’s scariest prisons”. In a post on Facebook, he described his life in the new prison where he said he had to sew for seven hours, five days a week. Navalny said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}After work, you continue to sit. For several hours on a wooden bench under a portrait of Putin. This is called ‘educational activities’. Even on Sundays, his official day off, he said he was made to sit on a wooden bench in a room for 10 years. He added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I don’t know who such activities can ‘educate’, except for a crooked invalid with a bad back. But maybe that’s the purpose.Navalny has described his new jail as a “prison within a prison” and said he was serving time with convicted murderers. In a Twitter thread, he compared his prison life to Putin and Russia’s former president, Dmitry Medvdev, and said there was a loudspeaker in his barrack that plays songs like “Glory to the FSB”.1/12 I live like Putin and Medvedev.At least I think so when I look at the fence around my barrack.

I have as much fun as I can. While sewing, I\\'ve memorised Hamlet\\'s monologue in English.Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports have fallen 43% year-on-year to 1.41m tonnes in June, having slumped since the start of the war as its Black Sea ports – the key route for shipments – have been largely closed off.Reuters reports the ministry said farmers in southern and eastern Ukraine had already started the 2022 harvest, threshing 293,800 tonnes of grain from around 1% of the sown area.The government has previously said Ukraine could harvest up to 65m tonnes of grain and oilseeds this year, compared with 106m in 2021, due to the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields.The process of Sweden and Finland joining Nato appears to have some difficulty ahead of it yet. The invitation must be ratified in parliament by all 30 allies, and there still seems to be some conflict between the Nordic countries and Turkey over what was agreed earlier in the week in Madrid. Turkey had threatened to veto their membership bids.Reuters reports that this morning Finnish foreign minister Pekka Haavisto said Finland and Turkey did not discuss the extradition of any specific individuals or groups of people during negotiations at the Nato summit.“We agreed that now we have a signed a text and everything that we have signed is in the text,” Haavisto told a news conference in Helsinki. “We did not, in Madrid, discuss about any individuals.”Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said yesterday that Finland and Sweden must keep promises of extraditions made during the talks, or ratification of the Nordic nations’ Nato memberships will not be sent to the Turkish parliament.After four hours of talks in Madrid on Tuesday, Turkey, Finland and Sweden signed a joint memorandum on security measures in exchange for Turkey lifting its veto on their Nato memberships, imposed by Ankara in May due to its concerns about terrorism. The signed memorandum did not list any individuals for extradition.Schools in Kyiv will reopen for classes for the start of the school year on 1 September, the city’s authorities said.Schools in the Ukrainian capital are now on summer holiday after going online when Russia launched its invasion of the country on 24 February. The head of Kyiv’s education and science department, Olena Fidanyan, was cited by AFP as saying that the most important task for the new school year “is the safety of students and teachers”.Territories adjacent to the schools will be checked for explosives and bomb shelters in schools will be restocked with water, medicine and other necessities, she said. All schools will hold “the necessary training with teachers and children on actions during an air-raid alert”, she added.Those children who have not been able to return to Kyiv will be able to study remotely, Fidanyan said.Russia has threatened to close its embassy in Bulgaria after Sofia announced that it would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff.Russia’s ambassador to Bulgaria, Eleonora Mitrofanova, said the closure of the Russian embassy would inevitably lead to the closure of Bulgaria’s embassy in Moscow.Earlier this week, Bulgaria’s prime minister, Kiril Petkov, said his country would expel 70 Russian diplomatic staff on espionage concerns. The move was the largest expulsion of Russian diplomats by Sofia in recent years and more than halved the size of Moscow’s diplomatic footprint in Bulgaria.Mitrofanova called the expulsions an “unprecedented hostile” step and on Thursday told Sofia to reverse its decision by midday on Friday.In a statement released by the embassy today, Mitrofanova said:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}Unfortunately, our appeal to the Bulgarian foreign ministry has been ignored.She added:.css-knbk2a{height:1em;width:1.5em;margin-right:3px;vertical-align:baseline;fill:#C70000;}I intend to quickly put the question of the closure of Russia’s embassy in Bulgaria before my country’s leadership, which will inevitably mean the closure of the Bulgarian diplomatic mission in Moscow.Responsibility for the “grave consequences of this step” will rest with Petkov’s government, Mitrofanova said. Moscow has told Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to sign a document within weeks certifying their willingness to switch to teaching the Russian school curriculum.The move puts many of them in a difficult position. If they do not sign, they will lose their jobs and be at risk of retaliation from Russian forces. If they sign, there is the risk of charges from Ukrainian authorities, which view teaching the Russian curriculum as a form of collaboration with the enemy.The Guardian spoke with teachers in Russian-occupied parts of south-east Ukraine whose identities, for safety reasons, cannot be revealed. They said that around mid-June newly appointed local authorities told them they had until 21 July either to sign a document certifying their readiness to follow the Russian school curriculum or resign, with many of them being threatened with eviction from their homes.The Russian education minister, Sergey Kravtsov, announced in June that when the new school year began in September all schools in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine were to work according to Russian standards.“We will do our best to open schools on 1 September so that they are as ready as possible to function according to Russian standards,” Kravtsov said. “Integration will take place. We are already taking some steps in this direction: teacher training and the supply of textbooks.”One teacher living in a village in the occupied area of Kharkiv said: “At the moment, only history, geography, language and primary schoolteachers were asked to sign the document.”“Math, physics, biology and chemistry curriculum in Russia don’t carry propaganda, so they are left alone, at least for now,” he added.Read the full article by Lorenzo Tondo: Moscow forcing teachers in Ukraine to sign up to Russian curriculumEight people have now been confirmed dead after a Russian missile strike on a residential building in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv on Wednesday, according to local officials.Ukraine’s state emergency service reported late last night that the body of a man was discovered under a collapsed staircase, bringing the total death toll to eight and six wounded. On Wednesday, mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said eight missiles had hit the city, adding that the residential building appeared to have been hit by a Russian X-55 cruise missile. Photographs from the scene showed smoke billowing from a four-storey building with its upper floor partly destroyed.\\n            Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you\\n        AT LEAST 17 people were killed and dozens wounded today in missile strikes on Ukraine’s Odessa region, a day after Russian troops abandoned positions on a strategic island in a major setback to the Kremlin’s invasion.The news came after Nato leaders wrapped up a summit in Madrid, with US President Joe Biden announcing $800 million in new weapons for Ukraine.“We are going to stick with Ukraine, and all of the alliance are going to stick with Ukraine, as long as it takes to make sure they are not defeated by Russia,” he said.But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov compared surging diplomatic tensions to the Cold War, telling reporters: “As far as an Iron Curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending… The process has begun.”There was a glimmer of hope however, when Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who visited Moscow on Thursday after a trip to Kyiv, said he had given Russian President Vladimir Putin a message from their Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Neither side has revealed what was in the note.Hours after the summit ended, missiles were fired at an apartment building and recreation centre in the southern region of Odessa, a strategic flashpoint that is home to Ukraine’s historic port city of the same name.The nine-storey apartment building was partially destroyed, leaving 14 people dead and 30 wounded, including several children, the emergency services said.Three people, including a child, were killed and one wounded in the attack on the recreation centre, they said.\\n    First responders try to extinguish flames at a residential building in Odessa\\n\\n    Source: AP/PA ImagesThe strikes, in the Bilgorod-Dnistrovsky district, were launched by aircraft that flew in from the Black Sea, said Odessa military administration spokesman Sergiy Bratchuk.“The worst case scenario played out and two strategic aircraft came to the Odessa region,” he said in a TV interview, adding they had fired “very heavy and very powerful” missiles.Bratchuk urged people not to post online information about the rescue operation.‘Goodwill gesture’The early Friday strikes came a day after Russian troops abandoned their positions on Snake Island, off the coast of Odessa.The island had become a symbol of Ukrainian resistance in the first days of the war, when the rocky outcrop’s defenders told a Russian warship to “go f*ck yourself” after it called on them to surrender — an incident that spurred a defiant meme.It was also a strategic target, sitting aside shipping lanes near the port of Odessa. Russia had attempted to install missile and air defence batteries while under fire from drones.The decision to abandon Snake Island “changes the situation in the Black Sea considerably,” Zelenskyy said in his daily address yesterday.“It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet guarantee that the enemy will not return. But it already considerably limits the actions of the occupiers.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited Snake Island as he warned the Russian president that any eventual peace deal would be on Ukraine’s terms.“We’ve seen what Ukraine can do to drive the Russians back. We’ve seen what they did around Kyiv and Kharkiv, now on Snake Island,” Johnson said.The Russian defence ministry statement described the retreat as “a gesture of goodwill” meant to demonstrate that Moscow will not interfere with UN efforts to organise protected grain exports from Ukraine.But Ukraine officials claimed it as a win.“They always downplay their defeats this way,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.In peacetime, Ukraine is a major agricultural exporter, but Russia’s invasion has damaged farmland and seen Ukraine’s ports seized, razed or blockaded — threatening grain importers in Africa with famine.Western powers have accused Putin of using the trapped harvest as a weapon to increase pressure on the international community, and Russia has been accused of stealing grain.‘Direct threat’Yesterday, a ship carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain sailed from Ukraine’s occupied port of Berdyansk, said the regional leader appointed by the Russian occupation forces.Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Moscow administration, said Russia’s Black Sea ships “are ensuring the security” of the journey, adding that the port had been de-mined.Separately, the Russian defence ministry said its forces are holding more than 6,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war who have been captured since the February 24 invasion.The conflict in Ukraine dominated the Nato summit in Madrid this week, as the alliance officially invited Sweden and Finland to join, and Biden announced new deployments of US troops, ships and planes to Europe.\\n\\n#Open journalism\\nNo news is bad news\\nSupport The Journal\\n\\n            Your contributions will help us continue\\n            to deliver the stories that are important to you\\n        \\n\\n\\n        Support us now\\n    \\n\\n\\n            Your contributions will help us continue\\n            to deliver the stories that are important to you\\n        Russian missiles continued to rain down elsewhere in Ukraine and a United Nations official said Thursday that 16 million people in Ukraine were in need of humanitarian aid.In the southern city of Mykolaiv, rescuers found the bodies of seven civilians in the rubble of a destroyed building, emergency services said.The city of Lysychansk in the eastern Donbas region — the current focus of Russia’s offensive — is also facing sustained bombardment.The situation in Lysychansk — the last major city the Russians need to take over in the Lugansk region — was “extremely difficult” with relentless shelling making it impossible to evacuate civilians, regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said.“There is a lot of shelling… The Russian army is approaching from different directions,” he said in a video posted on Telegram.©\\xa0AFP\\xa02022To embed this post, copy the code below on your site\\n600px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/war-in-ukraine-5804872-Jul2022/?embedpost=5804872&width=600&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n400px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/war-in-ukraine-5804872-Jul2022/?embedpost=5804872&width=400&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n300px wide\\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"460\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:0px;\" src=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/https://www.thejournal.ie/war-in-ukraine-5804872-Jul2022/?embedpost=5804872&width=300&height=460\" ></iframe>\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Facebook\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                        Twitter\\n                    \\n\\n\\nAccess to the comments facility has been disabled for this user\\nTheJournal.ie supports the work of the Press Council of Ireland and the Office of the Press Ombudsman, and our staff operate within the Code of Practice.

Nearby holiday camps were also hit.\"We came here to the site, assessed the situation together with emergency workers and locals, and together helped those who survived. And those who unfortunately died. We helped to carry them away,” said Oleksandr Abramov, who lives nearby and had rushed to the scene when he heard the blast.Serhiy Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa regional administration, said 21 people had been confirmed killed, including a 12-year-old boy. Authorities said earlier 41 people had been rescued from the apartment building where 152 lived.The regional governor said the Soviet-era missiles had been fired from the direction of the Black Sea.The Kremlin denied targeting civilians: \"I would like to remind you of the president\\'s words that the Russian Armed Forces do not work with civilian targets,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.The attack came just four days after Russia struck a crowded shopping mall in central Ukraine killing at least 19 people.Kyiv says Moscow has dramatically escalated its long-range attacks hitting civilian targets far from the front line in recent days, which Ukraine describes as a war crime. Russia says it has been aiming at military sites.Thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what Ukraine says is an unprovoked war of aggression. Russia calls the invasion a \"special operation\" to root out nationalists.On Thursday, Russia pulled its troops off Snake Island, a desolate but strategically important outcrop that it seized on the war\\'s first day and had used to control the northwestern Black Sea, where it has blockaded Odesa and other ports.In his nightly video address, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed what he described as a strategic victory at Snake Island.\"It does not yet guarantee security. It does not yet ensure that the enemy will not come back,\" he said. \"But this significantly limits the actions of the occupiers. Step by step, we will push them back from our sea, our land and our sky.\"Rescue workers work at the scene of a missile strike at a location given as Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi, Odesa region, Ukraine, in this handout image released July 1, 2022.? State Emergency Services of Ukraine/Handout via REUTERSIn Kyiv, Ukrainian lawmakers gave a standing ovation as the flag of the European Union was carried through the chamber to stand alongside Ukraine\\'s own flag behind the dais, a symbol of Ukraine\\'s formal EU candidate status granted last week.Zelenskiy and the lawmakers also stood for a minute of silence for those killed in the morning attacks near Odesa.Russia\\'s stepped up campaign of long-range missile attacks on Ukrainian cities has come as its forces have ground out success on the battlefield in the east, with a relentless assault to force Kyiv to cede two provinces to separatists.Moscow has been on the verge of capturing one of those provinces, Luhansk, since taking the city of Sievierodonetsk last week after some of the heaviest fighting of the war. Ukraine\\'s last bastion in Luhansk is the city of Lysychansk across the Siverskyi Donets river, which is close to being encircled under relentless Russian artillery assault.The Russians were shelling Lysychansk from different directions and approaching from several sides, regional Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Ukrainian television.\"The superiority in fire power of the occupiers is still very much in evidence,\" Zelenskiy said. \"They have simply brought in all their reserves to hit us.\"In Russian-occupied Sievierodonetsk, residents have emerged from basements to sift through the rubble of their city.\"Almost all the city infrastructure is destroyed. We are living without gas, electricity, and water since May,\" Sergei Oleinik, 65, told Reuters. \"We are glad that this ended, and soon maybe reconstruction will start, and we will be back to more or less normal life.\"But after its losses in the east, the Ukrainian victory at Snake Island gives Kyiv a major success in the Black Sea. The island has been a national symbol since the first day of the war when a Ukrainian guard ordered by Russia to surrender radioed back: \"Russian warship, go fuck yourself.\"Russia has used its control of the sea to impose a blockade on Ukraine, one of the world\\'s biggest grain exporters, threatening to shatter Ukraine\\'s economy and cause global famine.Moscow denies it is to blame for a food crisis, which it says is caused by Western sanctions hurting its own exports. President Vladimir Putin met the president of Indonesia on Thursday and spoke by phone on Friday to the prime minister of India, promising both major food importers that Russia would remain a big supplier of grain.Pushing the Russians off Snake Island could be a step towards reopening Odesa\\'s port, although military analysts say Russia could still threaten cargo ships at sea.Ukraine hopes to inflict enough damage in the east to exhaust Russia\\'s advancing army, and turn the tide in coming months with advanced weapons arriving from the West.In the latest sign of Russia\\'s split with Europe, Russia\\'s ambassador in Bulgaria said she would call for her embassy to be shut, along with Bulgaria\\'s embassy in Moscow, following Sofia\\'s refusal to reinstate diplomats it expelled for spying.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.An accord signed with Finland and Sweden to lift Turkey\\'s veto on their NATO membership bids is not the end of the matter and obliges the Nordic states to keep their promises, President Tayyip Erdogan was cited as saying on Friday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

All rights reservedAt least 19 dead after Russian missile strikes multi-story apartment building in Odesa; Russian forces withdraw from Snake Island in Black SeaAt least 19 people, including two children, have been confirmed dead after Russian missile strikes on an apartment building and resort in Odesa in southern Ukraine, according to Ukrainian officials. A further 38 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalised with injuries, Ukraine’s security service said. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Yevhenii Yenin, said there were no military targets or infrastructure in the vicinity of the areas struck by missiles. Speaking at the scene, Yenin said rescue operations were ongoing but “we don’t expect to find anyone alive”.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denied that Russia was hitting civilian targets. “I would like to remind you of the president’s words that the Russian armed forces do not work with civilian targets,” Peskov told reporters.Ursula von der Leyen has told Ukraine that there is “a long road ahead” for its bid to become a European Union member, but that “Europe will be at your side every step of the way”. In a speech via video link to Ukraine’s parliament this morning, the president of the European Commission said “There is a long road ahead but Europe will be at your side every step of the way, for as long as it takes, from these dark days of war until the moment you cross the door that leads into our European Union.”Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine’s path to European Union membership should “not take years or decades” and vowed to make Ukraine’s part of the process “perfect”. He said “Our path to membership should not take years or decades. We have to overcome this path quickly. Make our part of the job perfect. To enable our friends in the European Union to make another historic decision for us just as quickly and in a consolidated way.”Ukrainian forces said Thursday they have pushed Russian forces from Snake Island, a strategic Black Sea outpost off the southern coast. Russia portrayed the pullout from the island as a “goodwill gesture”. Ukraine’s military said the Russians fled the island in two speedboats after a barrage of Ukrainian artillery and missile strikes.The situation in the eastern Ukrainian city of Lysychansk is “extremely difficult” as Russian forces’ continuous shelling makes it impossible for civilians to evacuate, officials say. “There is a lot of shelling and from multiple directions. The Russian army is approaching from different directions towards Lysychansk,” Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Haidai said, adding that Russian forces remained on the city outskirts, where there was currently no street fighting.Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday a new “iron curtain” is descending between Russia and the west, and that Moscow would not trust Washington and Brussels “from now on”. The process “has begun”, Lavrov said after talks with his counterpart from Belarus. “As far as an iron curtain is concerned, essentially it is already descending.”Russia is using inaccurate missiles from old Soviet stocks for more than 50% of its strikes in Ukraine, leading to significant loss of civilian life, a brigadier general in Ukraine’s armed forces said on Thursday. The rate of Russian strikes in Ukraine has more than doubled in the past two weeks, Brig Gen Oleksii Hromov said at a news conference.A cargo ship left the Russian-occupied Ukrainian port of Berdiansk on Thursday for the first time since the city was seized by Moscow’s troops, according to a pro-Russia official. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, was cited by Russian state media as saying the first cargo ship to leave Berdiansk was carrying 7,000 tonnes of grain to “friendly countries”, without saying what cargo the ship was carrying.Hungary will speed up its defence development programme, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio. “We must radically increase our defence capabilities,” Orbán said. He reiterated that Hungary’s interest was for the war in neighbouring Ukraine to end as soon as possible.Joe Biden declared that the US and Nato allies will stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” as the military alliance promised hundreds of thousands more troops to defend eastern Europe. The US president also announced on Thursday another $800m of military aid to Kyiv – but questions remained over how much detail there was behind the plan to create a 300,000-strong force to deter any Russian attack.Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Sweden and Finland are expected to formally sign the Nato accession protocol on Tuesday. After the Nato summit in Madrid, Stoltenberg said leaders had decided to support Kyiv “to make sure Ukraine prevails as an independent sovereign state in Europe”.Turkey’s president has warned that Ankara could still block Finland and Sweden’s accession to Nato if the two countries fail to fully meet his expectations. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that if the two Nordic countries reneged on their promises, including to extradite terror suspects with links to outlawed Kurdish groups, Turkey’s parliament could refuse to ratify the deal reached on Tuesday.Estonian and Latvian defence ministers signed a letter of intent on Thursday at the Nato summit in Madrid for joint procurement of medium-range anti-aircraft systems.“The aggression of Russia in Ukraine clearly shows the need for air defence systems,” the Latvian defence minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a statement.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said France would deliver six Caesar howitzers and a “significant number” of armoured vehicles to Ukraine. He added that the Nato allies meeting in Madrid “unanimously decided” to boost humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine.The UK’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said it was a “realistic” ambition to push Russian forces out of Ukraine entirely. Asked whether the British government believed Russia could be pushed out of all of Ukraine within a foreseeable timeframe, Truss replied: “It is realistic, and that is why we are supplying the extra lethal aid we’re supplying.”Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the British ambassador in Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, to protest against Boris Johnson’s “offensive” remarks regarding Russia and Vladimir Putin. A strong protest was expressed to the ambassador over “the frankly boorish statements of the British leadership regarding Russia, its leader and official representatives of the authorities, as well as the Russian people”, it said in a statement.Norway’s foreign minister, Anniken Huitfeldt, has said her nation is not blocking Russian access to Svalbard. On Wednesday, Russia accused Norway of disrupting the delivery of critical supplies and threatened retaliation. Huitfeldt said Norway was not blocking Russian access to the Arctic archipelago, only applying international sanctions, and that Russia had other means to reach its settlements.The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Moscow on Thursday, where he will urge Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire and seek ways to allow the export of grain from Ukraine. Widodo also met with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Wednesday during a visit he described as a “manifestation of the Indonesian people’s concern for the situation in Ukraine”.{{topLeft}}{{bottomLeft}}{{topRight}}{{bottomRight}}{{.}}“We are fighting for our country and Western values,” explain Ukrainians. “And we won’t stop.”More than anything, it is this sense of patriotism and resourcefulness – and a little bit of help from Ukraine’s friends – that is likely to determine the war’s outcome.\\xa0The British spy George Blake, who defected to the Soviet Union, said just before his death in 2020 that spies now have “the difficult and critical mission” of saving the world “in a situation when the danger of nuclear war and the resulting self-destruction of humankind again have been put on the agenda by irresponsible politicians. It’s a true battle between good and evil.”Blake, who went over to the Russian side while a prisoner during the Korean War, may have inadvertently been describing Vladimir Putin’s irresponsible assault on Ukraine.\\xa0Unless the Russian leader wanted another Cold War, he has (so far) failed dramatically in strategic terms: first, in his aim to “liberate” Ukrainians from their government, and second, to curtail Nato’s enlargement.\\xa0With Finland and Sweden joining, he now has a much larger Nato on his borders – a 1,340km longer Nato, to be precise. He has ignited a fierce Ukrainian patriotism.\\xa0I have driven through more than 3,500km of Ukraine north to south over the past three months: there is scarcely a building without Ukrainian flags, banners, posters and painted walls.\\xa0How might this war end?The presence of such nationalism, shaped by the anvil of conflict and genocide under the Holodomor perpetrated by Stalin in the 1930s – in which millions of Ukrainians died of starvation due to the confiscation of their wheat – reduces the scenario options.\\xa0Those scenarios, which have Russia maintaining control over all or some of the roughly 20% of Ukrainian territory now occupied, can only be temporary – the conflict frozen, but unresolved.\\xa0The challenge for Ukraine is not only in stopping Russia grinding out its advances – for which heavier precision Western weaponry is required – but finding the means to remove them.\\xa0Unlike Russia, which has simply destroyed the cities targeted, such as Mariupol and now Severodonetsk, Ukraine’s counterattacks have to be tactically more astute and avoid civilian damage and casualties – it’s their own people and country, after all.\\xa0This outcome is not entirely down to Nato assistance, of course, but depends also on Russia’s economic and military strength.\\xa0The signs are not hopeful, given the claimed Russian military losses – 30,000 troops, 1,500 tanks, 2,500 armoured vehicles, more than 500 aircraft and 600 drones – which are expensive and time-consuming to replace, not least because of the skills required.\\xa0This will test the Russian economy, even if you believe the Russian media’s claim that it’s thriving due to a higher oil price.\\xa0At between $2-million and $5-million a pop for a tank, and at least 15 times for a fighter aircraft, war is expensive – and that is before Western sanctions begin to bite, which they will by the end of this year when Europe has committed to cut off Russian oil imports, a principal export earner. \\xa0\\xa0To some extent, the outcome depends on how the region works with Ukraine to get its trade routes for its commodities back up and running, including through Moldova, Romania and Poland especially.\\xa0It will also rely on what the world has learnt from Putin.\\xa0There will inevitably be those who call for appeasement, even though the record of feeding such authoritarians chunks of other people’s territory is seldom a formula for a durable peace.\\xa0Until now, Putin has successfully portrayed himself as a man who will stop at nothing, an irrational actor – “a monkey with a grenade”.\\xa0But this is a tactic designed to keep the West guessing at his unpredictability, especially over the use of nuclear weapons. Equally, when Russia decides to disengage – such as it did in redeploying its forces from around Kyiv in April or more recently from Snake Island – there was no monkeying around in the orderly and efficient withdrawal.\\xa0\\xa0But the West, too, possesses nuclear weapons. Deterrence is as much about politics, staying power and signalling as it is about hardware.\\xa0Nato’s problems have stemmed from its disparate organisational and political complement, though for now the differences in approach between its members are smaller than at any time in the post-Cold War order.\\xa0\\xa0And to the greatest extent, the outcome depends on the extent of Ukrainian fighting spirit and political will.\\xa0For the moment, President Volodymyr Zelensky’s approval ratings are over 80%. Whether this support will flag the longer the war drags on and the costs mount, or whether Ukrainians will further harden their position towards Russia as a consequence, remains to be seen.\\xa0For now, most Ukrainians are not interested in compromise. They demand compensation and justice.\\xa0It seems that this war will not end – conventionally or through a long-term insurgency – without a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukrainian territory. Those terms are, after all, what most countries would expect.\\xa0The human cost of the conflict thus makes a deal trading land for peace politically very difficult for Zelensky, no matter his obvious skills. After all, it is Ukraine that has been invaded.\\xa0The recent history of eastern and central Europe suggests that this occupation will, no matter the Russian propaganda, be bloody but temporary.

Western commentators said on Thursday (June 30) that the retreat of the Russians marks a major setback, and likely weakens their control over shipping routes that are key to Moscow’s strategic objectives.Last week Ukraine had said it had caused “significant losses” to Russia in airstrikes on the island. That hit was believed to be the second major military success using missiles given to the regime in Kyiv by the West.The Ukrainians had earlier claimed a first successful use of Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Reuters had reported, quoting British Military Intelligence.Both Moscow and Kyiv confirmed the Russian retreat. The Ukrainians said the Russians had caved in to sustained targeting of the island and Russian supply lines by missiles and artillery fire for more than a week.The last Russian soldiers had left on two speedboats during the night, the Ukrainian military said. “There are no more Russians on Zmiinyi (the Ukrainian name for the island),” The New York Times quoted Andrii Yermak, the head of the presidential office of Ukraine, as saying.The Ukrainian military had said on Tuesday (June 28) that it had destroyed three anti-aircraft missile systems that were recently installed by the Russians on the island. The radar had been knocked out, as a result of which Russia could no longer assist its soldiers on the island.The Russian defence ministry too said it had left the island, but sought to paint it as “a gesture of goodwill” that would “not allow Kyiv to speculate on the impending food crisis”, The NYT report said.Russian warships and submarines in the Black Sea have blocked Ukrainian grain exports, which averaged 5 million tonnes per month before the war. The crucial port of Odessa in the western Black Sea is still under Ukrainian control, but Western analysts were saying the Russian withdrawal from Snake Island did not necessarily mean traffic from the port would be more secure against Russian attacks.Snake or Serpent Island, called Zmiinyi in Ukrainian, is a rocky outcrop that extends less than 700 metres from end to end, and is often described as being “X-shaped”. It is located 35 km from the coast, to the east of the mouth of the Danube and roughly southwest of Odessa.The island has been known since ancient times. Tales about it go back to the mythological Trojan war, Reuters reported. It has a long association with Achilles, the mythical Greek warrior who was invincible but for his vulnerable heel.Today, the island is marked on the map by the tiny village of Bile that is located on it. The island is close to the coast of Romania, with which Ukraine has had a dispute — and which was settled in 2009 by the International Court of Justice, which drew a new maritime border between the two countries, a Reuters report said. Parts of the Black Sea around Snake Island are believed to hold significant oil and gas reserves.On February 24, the day Russia launched its invasion, two warships from the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Vasily Bykov and Moskva, attacked Snake Island, followed by Russian troops landing on it. A Ukrainian soldier’s salty response — “Russian warship, go f**k yourself” — quickly became the stuff of war legend. Ukraine issued a postage stamp celebrating his defiance, and in April, destroyed the Moskva, the 600-foot flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, which had attacked the island on day 1 of the war.Newsletter | Click to get the day’s best explainers in your inbox 📣 Join our Telegram channel (The Indian Express) for the latest news and updatesFor all the latest Explained News, download Indian Express App.'"
